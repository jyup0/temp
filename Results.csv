99An implication of this and the other 
simplifying assumptions noted is that the proposed 
requirement that eligible external LTD generally be issued at the holding company level would be no costlier to covered entities than an alternative rule that would also allow firms to meet the external requirement with LTD issued externally out of IDIs. This may not always be true. Some covered entities might, if permitted, prefer to partially meet the requirement with external IDI debt, for example, if they believed such a choice could incrementally lower their LTD interest cost."

(ii) Is not secured, not guaranteed by 
the covered BHC or a subsidiary of the covered BHC, and is not subject to any other arrangement that legally or economically enhances the seniority of the instrument; 
(iii) Has a maturity of greater than or 
equal to one year from the date of issuance; 
(iv) Is governed by the laws of the 
United States or any State thereof; 
(v) Does not provide the holder of the 
instrument a contractual right to accelerate payment of principal or interest on the instrument, except a right that is exercisable on one or more dates that are specified in the instrument or in the event of: 
(A) A receivership, insolvency, 
liquidation, or similar proceeding of the covered BHC; or 
(B) A failure of the covered BHC to 
pay principal or interest on the instrument when due and payable that continues for 30 days or more; 
(vi) Does not have a credit-sensitive 
feature, such as an interest rate that is reset periodically based in whole or in part on the covered BHC’s credit quality, but may have an interest rate that is adjusted periodically independent of the covered BHC’s credit quality, in relation to general market interest rates or similar adjustments; 
(vii) Is not a structured note; 
(viii) Does not provide that the 
instrument may be converted into or 
exchanged for equity of the covered BHC; and 
(ix) In the case of a debt instrument 
issued on or after [DATE OF PUBLICATION OF FINAL RULE IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER], is not 
issued in denominations of less than $400,000 and must not be exchanged for smaller denominations by the covered BHC; and
