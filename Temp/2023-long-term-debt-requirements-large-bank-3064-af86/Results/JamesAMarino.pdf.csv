Such a requirement could leave a signiﬁcant portion of the LTD uncounted and would force longer-maturity debt issuances than otherwise. Alternatively, the rule could allow counting all LTD but require the parent HC to extend the maturity of any internally issued LTD instrument if not doing so would breach the subsidiary’s required LTD holdings. In other words, internally issued LTD could not mature, and the funds leave the subsidiary unless LTD requirements are met. This would guarantee the loss-absorbing capacity at the subsidiary level. Counting LTD with a short remaining maturity at the parent company is less of an issue.

"Minimum remaining maturity and amortization. The proposed rule would disallow the counting of LTD instruments with a remaining maturity of less than one year. It would discount by 50 percent an instrument with a remaining maturity of between one and two years. Such a requirement could leave a signiﬁcant portion of the LTD uncounted and would force longer-maturity debt issuances than otherwise. Alternatively, the rule could allow counting all LTD but require the parent HC to extend the maturity of any internally issued LTD instrument if not doing so would breach the subsidiary’s required LTD holdings. In other words, internally issued LTD could not mature, and the funds leave the subsidiary unless LTD requirements are met. This would guarantee the loss-absorbing capacity at the subsidiary level. Counting LTD with a short remaining maturity at the parent company is less of an issue.

"The proposed rule treats external and internal LTD the same, for the most part. The calibration requirements for a covered HC are the same as for the covered IDI, based on identical percentages of risked-based assets or total consolidated assets. The restrictions and requirements of externally issued LTD are outlined in the NPR with the statement that internally issued LTD instruments essentially have the same structure. The limits and conditions typically are justiﬁed in the NPR by the need for the LTD to absorb losses.

"Minimum remaining maturity and amortization. The proposed rule would disallow the counting of LTD instruments with a remaining maturity of less than one year. It would discount by 50 percent an instrument with a remaining maturity of between one and two years. Such a requirement could leave a signiﬁcant portion of the LTD uncounted and would force longer-maturity debt issuances than otherwise. Alternatively, the rule could allow counting all LTD but require the parent HC to extend the maturity of any internally issued LTD instrument if not doing so would breach the subsidiary’s required LTD holdings. In other words, internally issued LTD could not mature, and the funds leave the subsidiary unless LTD requirements are met. This would guarantee the loss-absorbing capacity at the subsidiary level. Counting LTD with a short remaining maturity at the parent company is less of an issue. Suppose externally issued LTD is due to be replaced, and the parent HC cannot do so, presumably due to signiﬁcant ﬁnancial stress. In that case, remedies such as parent company bankruptcy may be necessary.

"The adoption of an SPOE resolution strategy and the abandonment of IDI LTD requirements have consequences, both good and bad.

On the other hand, requiring subordinated LTD to be held by the IDI ensures a more certain outcome if needed to cover losses.

On Sunday, March 19, S&P Global cut First Republic’s credit rating further into junk territory by moving it three notches from BB-plus to B-plus, warning an additional downgrade may be forthcoming and that the large-bank liquidity support may not be suﬃcient. First Republic’s liquidity continued to deteriorate throughout 24the remainder of March as FHLB borrowings increased from $14.0 billion to $28.1 billion and Federal Reserve discount window advances zoomed to $77.3 billion. By the end of March, First Republic’s external emergency funding had far outstripped its deposit base (see Table 4). First Republic’s liquidity position worsened throughout April, culminating in its closure on Monday, May 1, 2023. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Columbus, Ohio, acquired all deposit accounts and substantially all the assets. No systemic risk exception was necessary.

Close of business on a Friday is the FDIC’s preferred time and day of the week for a failure, 15as customers can conduct Friday’s business, and it allows the ensuing weekend to orchestrate a resolution transaction so that insured depositors can seamlessly access their funds the following Monday. A deviation from this time or day usually indicates something is amiss. A deposit insurance national bank (DINB) is a limited-service, temporary bank chartered by 16the OCC designed only to accept insured deposits from the failed institution with no power to accept assets. A DINB is structured to pay insured depositors via an operating bank rather than by issuing checks. Signiﬁcant detail on the failures of SVB and SBNY was obtained from: GAO, “Preliminary 17Review of Agency Actions Related to March 2023 Bank Failures,” April 2023, page 38 at https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-23-106736.pdf. To alleviate the adverse liquidity implications of a bank failure, the FDIC may provide 18advance dividends (payments) to uninsured depositors based on its failure loss estimate. For example, if the FDIC estimates uninsured depositors are expected to receive 80 cents on the dollar, it may provide them 75 cents on the dollar at the time of failure. The FDIC allows some cushion (in this example, 5 cents on the dollar) if the loss estimate is incorrect. Absent an advance dividend, uninsured depositors may not have access to their funds for months or even years, awaiting the liquidation of the failed bank’s assets.

Alternatively, the rule could allow counting all LTD but require the parent HC to extend the maturity of any internally issued LTD instrument if not doing so would breach the subsidiary’s required LTD holdings. In other words, internally issued LTD could not mature, and the funds leave the subsidiary unless LTD requirements are met. This would guarantee the loss-absorbing capacity at the subsidiary level. Counting LTD with a short remaining maturity at the parent company is less of an issue.

Close of business on a Friday is the FDIC’s preferred time and day of the week for a failure, 15as customers can conduct Friday’s business, and it allows the ensuing weekend to orchestrate a resolution transaction so that insured depositors can seamlessly access their funds the following Monday. A deviation from this time or day usually indicates something is amiss. A deposit insurance national bank (DINB) is a limited-service, temporary bank chartered by 16the OCC designed only to accept insured deposits from the failed institution with no power to accept assets. A DINB is structured to pay insured depositors via an operating bank rather than by issuing checks. Signiﬁcant detail on the failures of SVB and SBNY was obtained from: GAO, “Preliminary 17Review of Agency Actions Related to March 2023 Bank Failures,” April 2023, page 38 at https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-23-106736.pdf. To alleviate the adverse liquidity implications of a bank failure, the FDIC may provide 18advance dividends (payments) to uninsured depositors based on its failure loss estimate. For example, if the FDIC estimates uninsured depositors are expected to receive 80 cents on the dollar, it may provide them 75 cents on the dollar at the time of failure. The FDIC allows some cushion (in this example, 5 cents on the dollar) if the loss estimate is incorrect. Absent an advance dividend, uninsured depositors may not have access to their funds for months or even years, awaiting the liquidation of the failed bank’s assets.

I am an FDIC retiree (2014) who joined the agency in 1980 after receiving a Ph.D. in 2Economics from Iowa State University. I started with the FDIC’s Division of Research and Strategic Planning but eventually moved to the Division of Resolutions and Receiverships. My large-bank resolution experience dates back to the collapse of Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust in 1984. The views and opinions expressed herein are mine alone.1Many of these objectives are interrelated. Safeguarding ﬁnancial stability and promoting resiliency among banking organizations are directly related to systemic risk. Expanding options to resolve failed entities will most certainly reduce costs to the DIF , as another example. However, reducing systemic risk contagion stands out among these eight objectives. The failures of SVB and SBNY required a systemic risk exception that protected all depositors, something considered an option of last resort, especially since it involved consultation with the President of the United States and an implicit admission of plans gone wrong. The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act devoted much eﬀort to eliminating systemic risk exceptions.","64545 Federal Register / Vol. 88, No. 180 / Tuesday, September 19, 2023 / Proposed Rules  75On July 27, 2023, the agencies issued a  proposal to amend the capital requirements for  banking organizations with total assets of $100 billion or more and their subsidiary depository institutions (i.e., banking organizations subject to  category I–IV standards), and to banking organizations with significant trading activity (Basel III reforms proposal).

Close of business on a Friday is the FDIC’s preferred time and day of the week for a failure, 15as customers can conduct Friday’s business, and it allows the ensuing weekend to orchestrate a resolution transaction so that insured depositors can seamlessly access their funds the following Monday. A deviation from this time or day usually indicates something is amiss. A deposit insurance national bank (DINB) is a limited-service, temporary bank chartered by 16the OCC designed only to accept insured deposits from the failed institution with no power to accept assets. A DINB is structured to pay insured depositors via an operating bank rather than by issuing checks. Signiﬁcant detail on the failures of SVB and SBNY was obtained from: GAO, “Preliminary 17Review of Agency Actions Related to March 2023 Bank Failures,” April 2023, page 38 at https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-23-106736.pdf. To alleviate the adverse liquidity implications of a bank failure, the FDIC may provide 18advance dividends (payments) to uninsured depositors based on its failure loss estimate. For example, if the FDIC estimates uninsured depositors are expected to receive 80 cents on the dollar, it may provide them 75 cents on the dollar at the time of failure. The FDIC allows some cushion (in this example, 5 cents on the dollar) if the loss estimate is incorrect. Absent an advance dividend, uninsured depositors may not have access to their funds for months or even years, awaiting the liquidation of the failed bank’s assets.

"Minimum remaining maturity and amortization. The proposed rule would disallow the counting of LTD instruments with a remaining maturity of less than one year. It would discount by 50 percent an instrument with a remaining maturity of between one and two years. Such a requirement could leave a signiﬁcant portion of the LTD uncounted and would force longer-maturity debt issuances than otherwise. Alternatively, the rule could allow counting all LTD but require the parent HC to extend the maturity of any internally issued LTD instrument if not doing so would breach the subsidiary’s required LTD holdings. In other words, internally issued LTD could not mature, and the funds leave the subsidiary unless LTD requirements are met. This would guarantee the loss-absorbing capacity at the subsidiary level. Counting LTD with a short remaining maturity at the parent company is less of an issue. Suppose externally issued LTD is due to be replaced, and the parent HC cannot do so, presumably due to signiﬁcant ﬁnancial stress.
