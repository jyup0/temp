"Dear  Sir or Madam , "
 
We write on behalf of T he Credit Roundtable1 which is a group of investment managers 
serving institutional  and retail clients with a shared objective to improve fixed income 
market conditions for bondholders through education and advocacy . We believe that 
"enhancing bondholder protections benefits issuers, underwriters, and investors alike by "
laying the foundation for fair and efficient capital markets.  
 
Question 15:  Should the agencies take into consideration the resolution plan of a 
covered entity submitted pursuant to Title I of the Dodd -Frank Act in determining which 
"IDIs to scope into the proposed rule? For example, should the proposed IDI -level LTD "
requirement o nly apply to IDI subsidiaries of covered entities that have adopted an 
MPOE resolution strategy? What would be the advantages and disadvantages and 
potential incentive effects of applying an IDI - level LTD requirement to IDIs that are 
subsidiar ies of covered entities that have adopted an SPOE resolution strategy?  
The Credit Roundtable recommends that a gencies only require IDI LTD requirements 
for Category II -IV banks that choose a n MPOE resolution strategy. We see no inherent 
 
"1 [1] Formed in 2007, The Credit Roundtable (“CRT”) is a group of large institutional fixed income "
"managers including investment advisors, insurance companies, pension funds, and mutual fund firms, "
responsible for investing more than $ 5 trillion of assets. The Credit Roundtable advocates for creditor 
"rights through education and outreach and works to improve fixed income corporate actions, ineffective "
"covenants, and the underwriting and distribution of corporate debt. Its mission is to i mprove risk "
assessment and management through education and seeks to benefit all bond market participants 
"through increasing transparency, market efficiency and liquidity.  A current member list can be found here: "

Email Address: info@thecreditroundtable.org   reasons why the IDI of a Category II -IV bank that has adopted an SPOE resolution 
strategy should be treated differently than the IDI of a Category I bank that utilizes an 
SPOE resolution strategy by requiring it to issue internal TLAC. Aligning the treatment 
based on resolution strategy would add fairness and create incentives for Category II -IV 
banks to adopt SPOE resolution plans. It would also reduce complexity for investors of 
"bank LTD debt, which is typically positive for cost of funding.   "
"Given ongoing uncertainty in resolution outcomes after recent failures, The Credit "
Roundtable strongly encourages the agencies to finalize “source of strength ” rules as 
mandated by the Dodd -Frank Act.  
 
Question 27:  To what extent would limiting direct retail holdings of eligible external LTD 
contribute to concentration of eligible external LTD holdings by certain market 
participants?  
Holdings would be concentrated in insurance general accounts and large mutual funds 
"where retail investors have high exposure . As such, it wouldn’t meaningfully reduce "
retail investor exposure.  
 
Question 28:  What minimum denomination amount is most appropriate in the range of  
"$100,000 to $1 million? Would an amount greater than $400,000 be appropriate to "
provide further assurance these instruments will generally be held by investors who are 
well positioned to exercise market discipline and bear loss in the event of the failure of 
the issuer? Should the agencies require the debt instrument for eligible LTD to 
expressly prohibit their exchange into smaller denominations? Please explain.   
 
"The industry standard is $2,000 minimum denomination and this is the amount the CRT "
recommends for external LTD requirements. Many institutional asset managers manage 
separate accounts (SMAs) or smaller mutual funds that may have relatively modest 
balances.   It would not be unusual for a moderately -sized separate account for a 
"pension fund, endowment, or trust to be in the range of $20 -100 million.   Similarly, a "
newly seeded mutual fund or ETF might have as little as $3 -5 million in assets when 
first launched.   Higher minimum bond denominations would create many problems for 
"mandates of this size.   For example , a separately managed account with $100 million in "
assets would be required to take a 0.4% weighting to any new issue assuming a 
"$400,000 minimum denomination. The current market value weight of debt outstanding "
from Category II -IV banks ranges from 0.05% to 0.35% using the Bloomberg Credit 
"Index (see figure below). As such, this separate a ccount would be forced to take an "
overweight position in any Category II -IV bank debt it purchased relative to its 
"representation in the benchmark, potentially creating significant issuer concentration "
issues and diminishing overall portfolio diversificati on. We believe this analysis would 
not be materially different for other common benchmark credit indices.

This has material consequences for separately managed accounts with respect to 
"building a diversified client portfolio. To further illustrate this point, the below table "
 
  
"The Credit Roundtable, 25 North Broadway, Tarrytown, New York 10591  "
Website: www.thecreditroundtable.org     
Email Address: info@thecreditroundtable.org   shows the number of unique CUSIPs a SMA would be able to own to hold a market 
"weight position by category of bank.  For example , the manager of a $100mm separately "
managed account would only be able to buy 3 unique bonds from the 12 different 
Category 4 Banks in matching their aggregate ~1.20% benchmark market value 
"exposure (i.e., $400k x 3 = $1.2mm = ~1.2% of $100mm). This would  result in a "
significant portfolio diversification loss and an increase in client tracking error to their 
benchmark. It would also  lead to a n increase in funding costs for smaller banks as 
measured by the index representation of their debt which might subsequently be 
‘ignored’ by asset managers as they shift their asset allocation to the largest Banks. We 
believe this is at odds with regulators’ general intent to limit ‘Too Big to Fa il’ and the 
desire to have an economically viable regional banking landscape to serve the needs of 
U.S. small and medium -sized businesses .  
 
It is important to note that offering higher yields would not change the structural 
impediment to investing in bank debt  with larger minimum denominations . We expect 
the market would clear with a different investor base at a higher yield which would 
"negatively impact the cost of funding, lending capacity, system profitability, and "
competitiveness  of US regional banks.  
 
Larger minimum denomination s could also create challenges for some SMA and mutual 
"fund managers in allocating new issuance investments across accounts, which creates "
risks of not treating investors equally. It would also create problems when there are 
"flows into or out of these accounts – for example, a $10 million flow into or out of a $100 "
"million fund that has a bond holding with a $400,000 minimum denomination would "
make it impossible to add or reduce exposure to that position on a pro rata 
"basis.   Further, e xpressly prohibiting exchanging long -term debt into smaller "
denominations could increase market illiquidity and further concentrate these 
instruments into a small number of investors and mutual funds.  
 
We also note that US banks issue preferred securities that rank junior to LTD in 
"increments of $1,000 (“institutional preferreds”) and $25 (“retail preferred s”) that retail "
investors purchase. It is not clear why senior unsecured notes would be viewed as 
inappropriate  for retail investors while common and preferred equity are allowed  in low 
denominations . We also note that non -US banks issue senior unsecured debt in USD at 
much lower denominations than what is being proposed for US banks.

"Email Address: info@thecreditroundtable.org   If the agencies still believe that a minimum denomination between $100,000 and $1 "
"million is necessary, then the Credit Roundtable would recommend adding a Qualified "
Institutional Buyer (QIB) opt -out with respect to the higher denomination requirement . 
 
Question 30:  What would be the advantages and disadvantages of requiring eligible 
LTD issued by covered IDIs to be subordinated to general unsecured creditors? What 
"implications, if any, would subordination of eligible LTD to general unsecured creditors "
have for other  requirements?  
Requiring eligible LTD issued by covered IDIs to be subordinated to general unsecured 
creditors would reduce expected recovery on holding company LTD and increase the 
cost of funding.  
 
Question 64:  To what extent do the disclosure tables proposed increase the likelihood 
that market participants fully understand the creditor hierarchy? Should the Board 
"additionally require all Category II, III, and IV covered entities to provide the proposed "
disclosu res? 
The creditor ranking for resolution entity disclosure table would help market participants 
understand the creditor hierarchy. The Credit Roundtable recommends requiring it for 
all Category I -IV covered entities.  We recommend adding additional breakdown of 
TLAC/LTD maturities to include 0 -1 year and 1 -2 years. This disclosure should be 
provided in a similar cadence with other quarterly regulatory reports and preferably at 
the same time as earnings releases to give investors the required tools to assess 
related risk.  
 
Question 65:  Should the Board require a similar disclosure for liabilities of material 
subgroup entities of a TLAC HC?  
 
The Credit Roundtable recommends requiring similar disclosures for material subgroups 
of Category I -IV covered entities.
