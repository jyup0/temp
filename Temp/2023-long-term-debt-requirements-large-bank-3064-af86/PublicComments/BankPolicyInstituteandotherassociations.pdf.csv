Re:  Request for Extension of Comment Period for Resolution -Related Notices of 
Proposed Rulemaking  
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:

Association1 submit this letter requesting a 60-day extension of the comment period  for each of

"  the following four resolution -related proposals (together, the Resolution -Related Proposals ): "
"• Long -Term Debt Requirements for Large Bank Holding Companies, Certain "
"Intermediate Holding Companies of Foreign Banking Organizations, and Large "
Insured Depository Institutions ( Long -Term Debt Proposal );2 
• Resolution Plans Required for Insured Depository Institutions With $100 Billion 
or More in Total Assets; Informational F ilings Required for Insured Depository 
Institutions With at Least $50 Billion But Less Than $100 Billion in Total Assets 
(IDI Rule Proposal );3 
• Guidance for Resolution Plan Submissions of Domestic Triennial Full Filers 
(Domestic Filer Proposed Guidance ); and4 
• Guidance for Resolution Plan Submissions of Foreign Triennial Full Filers 
"(Foreign Filer Proposed Guidance  and, together with the Domestic Filer "
"Guidance, 165(d) Proposed Guidance ).5 "
We are  requesting extensions given the extent to which the four proposals relate to one 
"another, as well as to the currently open Basel III Endgame Proposal6 and, for several banking "
"organizations, the GSIB Surcharge Proposal .7 Specifically, we believe that co mment period "
extensions are appropriate because:  
"• the number , length, and complexity of the proposals require  detailed attention "
from affected banking organizations;  
• understanding certain of the effects of the proposals requires analysis and 
understanding  of the potential effects of other proposals;  
• comments on one proposal may relate to or affect comments on another proposal;

"  • the same personnel from affected banking organizations are, in many cases, "
responsible for analyzing the proposals.  
These fact ors all argue in favor of extending the comment periods for each of the Resolution -
Related Proposals so that banking organizations have sufficient time and resources to evaluate 
"the content of each proposal, as well as how they interact with one another. Accordingly, we "
"request a 60 -day extension of the comment period s for each of the Resolution -Related Proposals , "
"until January 30, 2024, or until the date that is 60 days following the end of the comment period "
"for the Basel III Endgame Proposal , which ever is later .  "
"To meaning fully comment on the proposals, it is vital for the public to understand how "
they all relate to one another and the collective impact that they would have on banking 
"organizations, their customers, and the financial system. This task is not limited to eval uating the "
"four Resolution -Related Proposals, which would already be a substantial undertaking given that "
they were issued simultaneously and have the same due date for comments. It is also critical to 
understand how the Resolution -Related Proposals build on the related Basel III Endgame 
"Proposal, which spans more than 1,000 pages.  "
"For example, if adopted, the Basel III Endgame Proposal would increase risk -weighted "
assets ( RWAs ) for the same banking organizations that would be subject to the Long -Term Debt  
Proposal. The RWA increases would “lead mechanically to increased requirements for [long -
"term debt] under the [long -term debt] proposal.”8 Thus, it is impossible for banking "
organizations to assess the proposed requirements and the cost and feasibility o f complying with 
"the Long -Term Debt Proposal without understanding what their RWAs may be. Ideally, "
commenters would be able to review and comment on the Long -Term Debt Proposal with the 
"benefit of knowing their final RWAs and capital requirements. At a mi nimum, commenters "
should be able to complete their review of the substantial Basel III Endgame P roposal before 
assessing the knock -on effects and providing comments on the Long -Term Debt Proposal.   
"As another example, the 165(d) Proposed Guidance for Cate gory II and III banking "
organizations contemplates new capital -related expectations and would require  banking 
organizations that follow a single point of entry ( SPOE ) resolution strategy to recapitalize a bank 
subsidiary to a level that “meet(s)  or exceed(s) all applicable regulatory capital requirements for 
‘well -capitalized’ status.”9 The proposal also states that “[t]he positioning of capital resources 
within the firm should be consistent with any applicable rules requiring prepositioned resources 
in IDIs in the form of long -term debt.”10 Assessing the feasibility and cost of these a spects of the 
"guidance, therefore, requires an understanding of both the applicable capital requirements and "
the long -term debt requirements that may apply to a banking organization.    
"Finally, commenters need sufficie nt time to consider the interactions among the "
"Resolution -Related Proposals themselves and to consider them holistically. Cumulatively, the "
"Long -Term Debt Proposal, the 165(d) Propos ed Guidance , and the IDI Rule Proposal could "
require  significant changes t o banking organizations’ resolution strategies; determining the 
"potential effect of these proposals requires evaluating several complex trade -offs. In addition, t he "
 
8 88 Fed. Reg. 64551.  
9 88 Fed. Reg. 64634.  
10 88 Fed. Reg. 64628.  -4- 
  165(d) Propos ed Guidance  and IDI Rule Proposal address two sets of similar but often varyin g 
"regulatory expectations and requirements, which also need to be considered in concert. It is not "
feasible to consider all of these interactions in the time currently provided  while institutions are 
also simultaneously assessing the Basel III Endgame Pr oposal.11 
These timing concerns are exacerbated by the fact that  the pending proposals draw on 
specialized expertise of subject matter experts at the affected institutions.  Banking 
organizations —particularly the midsize and regional banks that are most significantly affected 
by the Resolution -Related Proposals —will depend upon a fixed pool of subject matter experts to 
review  the pending proposals  simultaneously . Staff resources are similarly strained at U.S. 
"GSIB s because the November 30 comment deadline  coincides with the December 1, 2023, due "
"date for U.S. GSIBs’  next IDI plan  submissions . Accordingly, the same subject matter experts at "
these institutions that are currently engaged in finalizing their institutions’ IDI plans will be 
simultaneous ly tasked with reviewing the Resolution -Related Proposals  by effectively the same 
date. Extending the comment period for the Resolution -Related Proposals would allow the se 
subject matter experts more time to consider all of the pending proposals in light  of the Basel III 
Endgame Proposal. This would enable banking organizations to provide more thorough 
comments and would support a more complete analysis of the cumulative costs and benefits of 
the pending proposals.
