"Ladies and Gentlemen,  "
"Dear Mr. Sheesley, "
"By way of introduction, I, Manfred Eckhart Will, am the Founder & CEO of M|E|W Consul (“MEW”) - "
"www.mewconsul.de/en  - based in Germany. Area of expertise is risk management, with special focus on systemic risk.  "
MEW is honored to comment on the federal bank regulatory agencies “Proposed Rule to Require Large Banks to 
Maintain Long-Term Debt to Improve Financial Stability and Resolution” (RIN 3064-AF86).  
Every regulatory initiative is a good opportunity to also prepare the financial system for coming challenges. We know 
"already, and Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) has demonstrated it, that digitization (namely social media) shortens time "
"horizon, even more going forward in combination with wider adoption of instant payment and application of artificial "
intelligent (AI).  
" That is why I would like to look at the proposed regulation from a birds-view perspective, demonstrate the advantages "
of long-term debt (LTD) in combination with precautionary facilities.  
 
"Central banks, same as private financial institutions and system infrastructure providers, are more and more technology "
"driven, which allows learning from the experiences of private tech sector, for example software. Sector initially "
experienced problems with new products due to flaws in coding on a regular basis. Private hackers were considered 
"thread, until both sides started to collaborate. In the end firewalls and complete cyber security sector developed. Systems "
"are still getting infiltrated, but viruses are mostly quarantined, pose no systemic risk. "
"MEW believes the same applies for the financial sector, where collaboration of authorities with private sector will lead "
to independent risk management sector. Regulation provides uniform protection to all. Precautionary facilities allow 
every market participant to add additional protection according to individual business model and risk preference. Banks 
"and others financial institutions will still get in trouble, but fallout will be limited, pose no systemic risk. "

"On March 3, 2023 The Chicago Booth Initiative on Gl obal Markets Workshop on Market Dysfunction was hel d. "
Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman and Bank o f England Executive Director Andrew Hauser were out lining 
"necessity and core features of central bank precaut ionary facilities (CPF), based on experiences durin g “dash-for-cash” "
crisis in 2020 and LDI/gilts upheaval in 2022.  
 CPF can be combined with private precautionary fac ilities (PPF). And PPF can be structured as: 
"1.  Liquidity backstop, but also "
2.  Regulatory capital reserve (RCR). 
 
"Basically, PPF is a financial contract between one Insured Corporation and one or several private capi tal providers (i.e. "
"corporate credit investors such as public credit fu nds or pension funds, etc., same as LTB investors).   "
"Regarding current consultation, PPF contracts would  guarantee insured banks - large and small, listed and private - "
"access to LTD, in real time.  "
"PPF is a smart, highly flexible, decentralized solu tion. Technically, PPF contract is physically settl ed swaption, allowing "
insurant to swap corporate debt at any time for hig h quality liquid assets (HQLA) as per BIS or centra l bank definition. 
"Swap terms & conditions are fixed at inception, but  on a relative basis, not absolute pricing as is ma rket standard! CCP "
"clearing, 100% collateralized, physical settlement.  It’s the small print that matters.   "
"The pricing level will be dependent on credit stand ing of insurant, while regular premium of individua l transaction will "
"correlate with size, maturity, currency, etc. All w e know today, regular PPF cost will be a fraction o f cost of capital only. "
Regulatory agencies can decide how to use cost effi ciency: 
"1.  Keep cost level for insured bank unchanged, and max imise safety standard, "
"2.  Keep safety standard for individual bank unchanged , and minimise cost, or "
3.  Split the cost advantage. 
Recent complains from major Wall Street banks regar ding negative economic impact of tighter regulatory  standards are 
"definitely not warranted. CEO arguments look outdat ed, ignoring innovation deliberately to protect sta tus quo.  "
 
Looking at last years SVB situation as reference an d the advantages are obvious:  
"1.  Financial and non-financial business can get PPF co ver, giving corporate depositors safe and cost-effi cient "
"alternative to non-operational liquidity reserve; c orporate deposits would have been smaller from begi nning,  "
"2.  SVB would have access to HQLA in real time and at m arket value to replenish dwindling liquidity reserv e,  "
"3.  Failed attempt to raise additional capital avoided,  RCR PPF structure guarantees real time access to r egulatory "
"capital (AT1), and "
4.  Most important during stress situation is psycholog y; the fact that banks can demonstrate to the marke t that it 
"can raise additional reserve even in challenging en vironment often more important than details such as  size, "
"procedure, etc.   "
 
"PPF is a simple solution, which are the most diffic ult to develop. Plus, simplicity allows standardiza tion, precondition "
"for commoditization, and hence cost-efficiency. MEW  recons regular PPF premium will only be fraction c ompared to "
"cost of capital, as already mentioned.  3  "
 
 
"Additionally, liquidity PPF is attractive for financial but also non-financial businesses. That is important for capital "
"providers/underwriters, since it allows managing credit risk via diversified investment portfolio. This is in contrast to "
"specialized banking solutions, which are always highly correlated as we experienced last year again.   "
" Every individual PPF should be treated alike insurance companies from a regulatory perspective. As a result, watertight "
"regulation is highly recommended: structure, documentation, supporting assets, distribution, settlement, reporting, etc.   "
Combination of standardization plus regulation allows seamless PPF integration into existing safety architecture. 
"Therefore, real time exercise of the swaption in case of stress on financial system level, on financial market level, on "
financial sector level or on individual insurant level no problem.   
 
"MEW already had initial discussion with FedNow regarding real time liquidity backstop, is looking forward to more "
"detailed exchange as part of dedicated working group, aiming for full PPF regulation/certification. It is important to once "
"more emphasize the flexibility of PPF - liquidity and capital, financial and non-financial – essential in a digital and AI "
"driven environment going forward. SVB confirmed, current set-up hardly capable of handling the much higher speed of "
tech savvy market participants.   
 
"Summarized, Proposed Rule to Require Large Banks to Maintain Long-Term Debt to Improve Financial Stability and "
Resolution in combination with PPF will be of advantage to authorities and banking sector during all phases: stable 
"environment, stressed situation and following bank failure.  "
"Precautionary facilities will reduce the number of failed banks – G-Sib, large and small - and reduce required FDIC and "
therefore taxpayer support.  
For MEW the introduction of precautionary facilities – central bank and private – goes beyond the solution for a single 
"regulatory problem, instead is necessary preparation for digital and AI driven future.  "
Recent IMF report is highlighting “Financial Stability Needs Supervisors with the Ability and Will to act”. PPF set-up 
"will significantly reduce complexity of supervision, improve transparency of private sector risk management, plus make "
it easier for regulatory agencies to intervene. 
"Well-structured PPF are flexible regarding technological and regulatory changes, complementary to any regulatory and "
"stabilization measures, including proposed LTB rule, and easy to integrate into existing safety architecture.   "
  
Whatever the exact regulation of large banks will look like and how features of LTB will be determined by federal bank 
"regulatory agencies, the result in combination with precautionary facilities will be superior in any conceivable scenario. "
 
"Best regards, "
