"Addendum : Long -term De bt Requirements for Large Bank Holding Companies, Certain Intermediate Holding Companies "
"Foreign Banking Organizations, and Large Insured Depository Institutions  "
 
 
"Dear Ms. Misback, Mr. Sheesley , and Chief Counsel’s Office , "
 
"Further to our letter dated September 26, 2023, Breckinridge Capital Advisors  is offering addendum (a) below based on "
our conviction that altering the minimum denomination rule would negatively impact  the structure of the U.S. bank bond 
"market, reduce trad ing activity, and diversification options for investors.  "
 
Breckinridge opposes  a recent proposal that would require such banks to issue external long -term debt (LTD) in minimum 
"denomination sizes of $400,000. Instead, we recommend that regulators : "
 
(a) make no change in the minimum denomination size rule . U.S. bank LTD obligations are most often issued in minimum 
"denominations of $5,000 or less. For example, 98 percent of JPMorgan Chase  1 Dollar -denominated bonds and 92 "
 
1 JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is the second largest bond issuer in the US corporate bond market with $161bn outstanding or about 2.3% of 
"the market value of the Bloomberg US IG Corporate Bond Index. For inclusion in this Index, a bond issue must have a minimum "
outstanding par value of $300mn. JPM has 70 outstanding bonds that meet the criteria for Index inclusion. In reviewing the mi nimum 
"denominations of each issue, we observe the following distribution: 98 percent of JPM outstanding US$ bonds, have min imum "
"denominations of $2,000 or below. This allows for broad ownership across retail and institutional investors.  "

"percent of Bank of America  2 Dollar -denominated bonds are sold and trade in this manner, allowing for broad ownership "
"across retail and institutional investors . Moreover, Trading Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE) data shows that "
"about 40 percent of trades in select benchmark ba nk bonds, using Bank of America 3 and JPMorgan Chase 4 as proxies, "
occur in smaller lot sizes . Trading in s maller lot sizes creates important liquidity for broker -dealers and mid-sized investors 
in the bank bond market.  
 
We strongly recommend no change to the minimum denomination size rule.

"market value of the Bloomberg US IG Corporate Bond Index. For inclusion in this Index, a bond issue must have a minimum outstanding "
par value of $300mn. BAC has 72 outstanding bonds that meet the criteria for Index inclusion. In reviewing the minimum 
"denominations of e ach issue, we observe the following distribution: 92 percent of BAC outstanding US$ bonds have minimum "
"denominations of $5,000 or below. This allows for broad ownership across both retail and institutional investors. "

"new issuance (4/19/23), through 9/7/23. Of that amount, 58 percent or 2,956 of the trades were above $250,000 in size, while 41 "
"percent or 2,100 trades were below $25 0,000. This data point shows that smaller trades are an important component in this BAC "
"bond, in terms of liquidity.  "
