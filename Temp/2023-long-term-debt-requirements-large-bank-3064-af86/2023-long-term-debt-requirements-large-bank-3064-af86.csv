"64552 Federal Register / Vol. 88, No. 180 / Tuesday, September 19, 2023 / Proposed Rules  99An implication of this and the other  simplifying assumptions noted is that the proposed  requirement that eligible external LTD generally be issued at the holding company level would be no costlier to covered entities than an alternative rule that would also allow firms to meet the external requirement with LTD issued externally out of IDIs. This may not always be true. Some covered entities might, if permitted, prefer to partially meet the requirement with external IDI debt, for example, if they believed such a choice could incrementally lower their LTD interest cost."
"64553 Federal Register / Vol. 88, No. 180 / Tuesday, September 19, 2023 / Proposed Rules  107For simplicity, the agencies assume that  pricing any eligible internal debt securities would  be consistent with market pricing and terms for eligible external LTD (including but not limited to the eligibility requirements under the proposal).   108In addition to the total increase in funding  costs, the agencies also estimate the credit risk component of these funding costs. Because credit spreads reflect the market expectation of losses that would be absorbed by eligible LTD investors in per annum terms, the component speaks directly to the proposal’s expansion of loss absorbing capacity."
