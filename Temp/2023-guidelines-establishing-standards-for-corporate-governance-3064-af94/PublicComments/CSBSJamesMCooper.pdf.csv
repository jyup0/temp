Re: Guidelines Establishing Standards for Corporate Governance and Risk Management for Covered 
Institutions With Total Consolidated Assets of $10 Billion or More  
 
The Conference of State Bank Supervisors (“CSBS”)1 respectively requests that the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) extend  the deadline  of the comment period for the notice of proposed 
rulemaking and issuance of guidelines entitled “Guidelines Establishing Standards for Corporate 
Governance and Risk Management for Covered Institutions With Total Consolidated Assets of $10 Billion 
or More”2 (“proposal” or “guidelines”).  
 
State bank supervisors  are the chartering authority and primary regulator of all firms  that would be 
"subject to  the proposal , and thus have a significant stake in the proposed guideline s. CSBS and its "
"members  are currently reviewing and analyzing the proposed guidelines , which  raise  a number of "
"significant policy issues , questions, and concerns  related to state corporate governance laws, director "
"and officer responsibilities , and standards applicable to state nonmember banks, state member banks, "
and national banks .   
 
CSBS employs a  policy development process  that help s ensure  the policy positions it adopts reflect  the 
perspectives of state bank supervisors. This process requires extensive deliberation among members to 
foster consensus which may not be feasible under the 60 -day deadline for submitting comments on the 
"proposed guidelines . Additionally, this proposal was released while multiple complex and lengthy policy "
proposals  remain  under consideration by state regulators . 
 
Given the serious policy issues raised by the proposed guidelines  and the significant stake of state bank 
"regulator s, CSBS respectfully requests that the FDIC provides, at minimum, a 30 -day extension of the "
deadline to submit comments on the propos al. 
 
"Sincerely,  "
James  M. Cooper  
President and CEO
