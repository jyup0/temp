"Re: Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, Guidelines Establishing Standards for "
Corporate Governance and Risk Management for Covered Institutions with  
"Total Consolidated Assets of $10 Billion or More , 88 Fed. Reg. 70391  (RIN: "
"3064 -AF94 ) (October  11, 2023 ) "
 
"Ladies and Gentlemen,  "
 
The following comments are provided on behalf of the Independent Bankers 
"Association of Texas (“IBAT”), a trade association that represents the "
"independent community banks of Texas, to the above -referenced Notice of "
Proposed Rulemaking relating to Establis hing Standards for Corporate 
Governance and Risk Management for Covered Institution (the 
“Guidelines”).  IBAT member banks range in size from $27 million to $52 
"billion in assets, serving Texans in communities of every size.  "
 
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) is seeking comment on 
proposed corporate governance and risk management guidelines that 
"would apply to all insured state nonmember banks, state -licensed insured "
branches of foreign banks  and insured state savings associations that are 
"subject to Section 39 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act), with "
total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more on or after the effective date 
of the final Guidelines.  
 
The following statements represent  our concerns with the proposed 
Guidelines:  
 
• The Guidelines add another agency rulemaking to the list that 
potentially runs into the Supreme Court’s newly strengthened and 
evolving major questions doctrine.  While Congress has clearly 
authorized the prudential regulators  to supervise banks and 
"promulgate related standards, the evolving doctrine may reduce the "
"degree of deference federal courts give to agency discretion, absent "
clear and specific congressional authorization.  If the corporate 
"governance of banks is classified as a major question of pub lic policy, "
then federal banking authorities would need to point to clear 
congressional authorization for them to prescribe corporate 
governance mandates.  
" • The Guidelines are more prescriptive than descriptive.  As proposed, the Guidelines would give the FDIC "
the authority to identify banks under the size threshold that “are highly complex or present a heightened 
risk that warrant the application” without any  specificity as to when the FDIC would exercise that authority  
or how smaller banks could be swept up .  The Guideline s are unreasonably vague on how any bank – large 
or small – could properly comply with the proposed requirements.  
 
• The Guidelines apply only to state non -member banks and do  not consider state laws . That could  lead to 
inconsistencies between banks and unknow n exposures to covered banks and boards.  
 
• The Guidelines require a covered bank to timely report violations of said Guidelines  to the agency with 
jurisdiction.  The vagaries of the Guidelines make this particularly difficult  as to what is reportable and 
"when it must be reported .  Additionally, this requirement would appear to be the first of its kind in federal "
banking law and does not have precedent in the historical approach of the FDIC or of the other federal 
banking agencies.  
 
• The Guidelines do not provide for a transition period to achieve compliance with new enforceable 
"requirements . If adopted as proposed, compliance would apparently be expected for covered institutions "
"on the effective date of the final Guidelines , meaning a covered bank could be forced to immediately "
change their board composition and quickly find additional independent directors  – for small community 
"banks that could be drawn into this, that is particularly troublesome.  "
 
• Adoption of the Guidelines appears to make  board member s potentially liable to both consumers and the 
general public  under the standard of simple negligence.   This is a novel approach  that could have a 
dramatic impact on banks and their ability to recruit and retain qualified directors.  Bank boards  have 
historically been charged with governing the bank and not directly managing the bank.  These Guidelines 
appear to upend that precedent.   We believe there ought to be a strong ongoing distinction between 
governance and management.   
 
• The Guidelines require that bank boards  approve “core policies ” at least annually.  While providing some 
"examples of “core policies ” that are essentially addressed in other regulations, the Guidelines don’t go "
"beyond that to define what is a “core policy. ”  The Guidelines, as written, could inundate the board with "
policies that are best left to managers of the various business lines of the bank.  
 
• The governance standards outlined in the Guidelines would require covered banks to establish and 
"operate a complex, formal risk management framework.  The financial cost and time required by the board "
"and management to stand up such programs, build systems  and sustain them would impose a significant "
"burden on those covered banks. Even more significantly, many affected banks are located outside of major "
"metropolitan areas, making it difficult to recruit and retain talent with the specialized experience neede d "
to satisfy the agency’s expectations.  
 
• The Guidelines provide little direction as to when a covered bank’s risk profile and that of its parent 
company would be “substantially similar” while also “easily distinguished and separate from” one another.  
 
"• Finally, additional costs associated with these Guidelines add s yet another “cost” to operating the bank "
that will inevitably be passed on to consumer s via higher costs  and to employees via decreased 
compensation and benefits.  
 Thank you for your consideration of our concerns .
