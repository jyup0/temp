 James P . Sheesle y 
Assistant Execu�ve Secretary  
Federal Deposit Insurance Corpora�on  
"550 17th Street NW , Washington, DC 20429.   Aten�on: Comments/Legal OES (RIN 3064– AF94)  "
 To Mr. Sheesley and members of the Corpora�on:  
 
I very much appreciate the opportunity to comment on the proposed Guidelines Establishing 
Standards for Corporate Governance and Risk Management for Covered Ins�tu�ons With Total Consolidated Assets of $10 Billion or More. I strongly support the proposed rule.  
 
"Beyond the deference that is earned by a regulatory body ’s exper�se, the FDIC is en�tled to an "
addi�onal layer of deference because it is not just an overseer; it is a par�cipant. And no en�ty 
is more dedicated to risk -beneﬁt assessment than  an insurer. If it was opera�ng solely as a 
"private insurance company, it would insist on the provisions of this proposed rule in its "
contractual agreements with the insured ins�tu�ons.  
 
"In other words, the  corporate governance rules outlined in the pr oposed rule are cost -eﬀec�ve, "
"essen�al for mi�ga�ng risk, and well- established as best prac�ce"
i for public corpora�ons not 
"just in the US but in other economies as well. Indeed, there is not a single corporate governance "
 2 best prac�ces list that doe s not include these provisions. Your proposal underscores this by 
poin�ng out:  
 
An eﬀec�ve governance framework is necessary for an insured depository ins�tu�on to 
"remain proﬁtable, compe��ve, and resilient through changing economic and market "
condi�ons. The board of directors serves a cri�cal role in maintaining an insured 
depository ins�tu�on ’s safety and soundness and con�nued ﬁnancial and opera�onal 
resilience.  
 
The FDIC observed during the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis and more recent bank fai lures in 2023 
that ﬁnancial ins�tu�ons with poor corporate governance and risk management 
prac�ces were more likely to fail….   
" The FDIC expects all FDIC -supervised ins�tu�ons to have good corporate governance, "
including the key component of an ac�ve and involved board protec�ng the interests of the ins�tu�on rather than the interests of the parent or aﬃliate of the ins�tu �on. The 
proposed Guidelines for covered ins�tu�ons emphasize the importance of developing a 
strategic plan and risk management policies  and procedures and selec�ng and 
supervising senior management so that a covered ins�tu�on will operate in a safe and 
"sound manner. The proposed Guidelines also emphasize the importance for the board and management to adopt a code of ethics, to demonstrate high ethical standards in "
"the covered ins�tu�ons ’ opera�ons, and to act to ensure the covered ins�tu�on and "
"its employees adhere to applicable laws and regula�ons , including consumer "
"protec�on laws and regula�ons, and the Community Reinvestment Act. [emphasis "
added and footnote s omited]  
 
The fundamental element of capitalism is minimizing agency costs. No on e outside the 
enterprise will risk capital unless the system assures the money will be used for long -term 
returns to beneﬁt investors and not for the beneﬁt of insiders. We give providers of capital that assurance through a combina�on of disclosure and structural requirements and accountability 
through market and law -and-regula�on -based provisions.  A cornerstone of that assurance 
comes from the board of directors. Investors must be able to rely on the board to resolve conﬂicts of interest in their favo r. That includes execu�ve compensa�on – insiders generally 
prefer less variability than investors – o�en a key indicator of poor performance risk and a key 
indicator of an ineﬀec�ve board as well.  
 
"The board is also there to manage risk, and that includes overseeing compliance, audit and "
"accoun�ng, development of strategy, and ethics. People o�en misunderstand the importance of "
"ethics, thinking it has something to do with the Golden Rule and singing hymns. But ethics is "
"really just another element of risk management. Over and over, we have seen major corpora�ons fail due to ethics viola�ons, from Enron (which got its board to sign oﬀ on a waiver of the company ’s ethics rules) to FTX (which did no t have a CFO, board, or compliance oﬃcer "
and which lied about its accessing of customer funds).  
  3 Markets do not run on money; they run on trust. The FDIC ’s own ﬁndings on the failure of the 
"Republic Bank included “a loss of market and depositor conﬁde nce, resul�ng in a bank run. ” "
"Everything FDIC is proposing in this rule will increase conﬁdence in the ﬁnancial ins�tu�ons , and "
"that conﬁdence will be earned.  Therefore, with regard to the speciﬁc ques�ons asked by FDIC "
"about the proposed rules, I do not believe there is any reason to limit the imposi�on of these "
requirements based on the size of the ins�tu�on. Every corpora�on with outside investors 
"should have a majority of independent directors, a risk commitee, and a code of ethics, and should comply with other laws already in place. In every situa�on, those requirements are cost - "
"  eﬀec�ve. At a minimum, I would impose a “comply -or-explain ” requirement on the smaller "
"ins�tu�ons. This op�on is raised in your fourth ques�on, about a po ssible exemp�on for “risk "
"and complexity .” Risk and complexity are the reason for these rules, not a reason to waive "
them. An exemp�on should only be granted in the rare cases where a covered ins�tu�on can 
show that it is mee�ng the goals of risk mi� ga�on and accountability with a beter system. This 
"will encourage innova�on  instead  of excusing them without this kind of demonstrable proof , "
"which  would just increase risk. Similarly, the fourteenth ques�on, is a reminder that whenever "
"possible, rules  should be based on performance standards rather than design (structural) "
"standards. There should always be incen�ves to come up with beter, less burdensome , and less "
"expensive ways to achieve the goals , but not to evade them . "
 The proposal asks what other governance improvements commenters would recommend. I 
would recommend that directors be allowed to serve only if they get more than 50 percent of 
the shareholder vote. Since insiders generally control the nomina�on process and they run 
"unopposed, a “ withhold” vote is the only way for shareholders to show their disapproval. "
"Legally, they may s�ll serve if they get even a single vote. But if a majority of shareholders decline to approve them, they should not be allowed to serve as directors.  The term "
“independent director ” may need addi�onal clariﬁca�on. It should mean someone who has 
"never been an employee or service provider and has no family or other connec�ons or aﬃlia�ons through for -proﬁt, non -proﬁt, or other organiza�ons with the ins�tu� on’s execu�ves "
"or the other board members.   I have no�ced, in recent years, that there are a number of comments on proposed rules that are submited by groups or individuals that appear to be independent but are in reality funded by industry sources or  by undisclosed insiders. I hope the staﬀ will review the funders of those who "
"comment . I especially hope the staﬀ will be skep�cal about any un -audited, un -veriﬁed claims of "
the expense of complying with the rule.  
 I want to emphasize that I am wri� ng en�rely on my own behalf as a long -�me observer and 
scholar of corporate governance
ii. I use the leterhead of my company for purposes of 
"iden�ﬁca�on, but this comment expresses my views only. Neither I nor my partners have any connec�on to or reve nue from FDIC -insured companies and none of our clients will beneﬁt in "
"any way other than the incidental beneﬁts for all shareholders. Again, I welcome the  4 opportunity to comment, and I am happy to meet with staﬀ or provide further informa�on if it "
wou ld be helpful.  
" Sincerely,  "
