"I am a Chief Risk Officer at a State Chartered Bank,  and I am strongly in favor of the proposed new guidance . "
I believe i t will  provide additional consistency and support  for bank  risk management practices  at smaller  
banks .   
"However, I also believe that considering  deposit size rather than only asset size more directly correspond s "
to the need for the broader application of th is risk management framework.  Any institution with insurable 
"deposits greater than approximately one  billion dollars, represents a potentially material level of monetary "
"risk to the deposit  insurance fund. Therefore , I suggest extending the guidance to include  banks  that have "
between one and five billion  dollars  in insurable deposits even if they have less than ten billion in ass ets.   
The main reason touted  by bankers from smaller banks for resisting more comprehensive risk 
"management approaches has been the cost. I believe this to be a false premise  for two reasons; First, the "
cost of enhanced risk management usually  more  than pays for itself by preventing or mitigating future 
"financial losses. Second, the general advancement s in information technology now enable strong "
monitoring and analysis of risk related data at very reasonable costs.  
"Finally, I have a second  recommendation that  I believe  should  be considered for  the extension of the  "
"regulatory guidance.  In order for the three line of defense approach to be effective, the heads of both the "
"second and third line must be independent of management. For publicly  traded banks, the only way to "
achieve this is to have the heads of the second line and third line report directly to either the Board of 
Directors  or an appropriate Director subcommittee . The head of the second line should report di rectly to 
the Risk committee and the head of the third line should report directly to the Audit committee . The heads 
of the second and third lines of defense should  be the “eyes ” and “ears ” of the Board of Directors.   This 
enables the Board to get a more objective and compreh ensive  perspective on the risks being taken by 
"management. CEO’s of publicly traded  companies are focused on enhancing shareholder value, not "
"corporate governance . To be truly independent , the advancement and compensation for risk governance "
"heads , as well as their staffing and resources, must be exclusively approved  by the Board of Director s.   In "
"addition , there should be at least quarterly mandatory Director committee sessions  with the second line  "
and third  line heads . These separate session s should not include the CEO or other members of the first 
"line management. Without t rue independence  and segregation of reporting lines , the ex tension of "
coverage of this regulatory guidance  will be  of limited value .  Thank you for your time and consideration .  
"Best regards , "
