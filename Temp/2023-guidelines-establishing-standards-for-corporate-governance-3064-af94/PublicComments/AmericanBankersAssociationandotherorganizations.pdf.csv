Re: Request for Extension of Comment Period for Pr oposed FDIC Guidelines on Corporate

total of 120 days) f or interested s takeholders to s ubmit comments i n response t o the Proposed

"and employees. Accordingly, a number of directly affected and other stakeholders will need time to "
analyze and contribute their perspectives on this issue.   
The Proposal indicates that it was not intended to represent a significant departure from current 
"bank practices established under the guidance previously provided by the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Board, or the FDIC’s own examination  program. The wide gulf however, between "
the FDIC’s intentions and the results and consequences that our members perceive is in itself a 
compelling reason for the FDIC to provide the requested additional time for stakeholders to analyze the 
"Proposal and pr ovide informed comments. If, as the FDIC believes, the Proposal does not effectuate "
"significant change, an extension of 60 days will have no practical impact. If, as our members believe, the "
"Proposal would implement extensive change, then the requested 60 -day extension is necessary.  "
Among the specific concerns we have already identified that require thorough analysis are the 
following:  
•The Proposal would appear to be inconsistent with the governing corporate law of the states in
"which covered banks are chartered. For example, the Proposal would establish a mandatoryconstituency requirement (and add to the list of constituents), which ha s been rejected in every"
state.
•T
he Proposal would radically alter the eligibility requirements for covered bank directors and
create not only inconsistency but conflict.
•T
he Proposal would increase the potential liability of covered bank directors and officers beyond
that for the directors of all other corporations. Commenters will need to devote considerableattention to the risk that these elevated requirements will have on the pool of directors and
officers.
•A
mbiguities and lack of detail in some aspects of the Proposed Guidelines create the potent ial
f
or unintended consequences.
•I
"nsured banks are subject to a vast and complex array of laws and regulations, both those that"
are specific to banking and those of general applicability.  The Proposed Guidelines wouldinclude an unprecedented requirement for a covered bank timely to repo rt known or suspected
"violations of law or regulation to various government agencies without any materiality standard,level of certainty that a violation has occurred or clarity on the timing of such reporting.Stakeholders will require sufficient time to  evaluate the legal ramifications, complexities and"
"consequences of this novel requirement, particularly because the question of illegality can oftenbe highly fa ct-specific and dependent on government and judicial positions that change over"
"time. Furthermore, a requirement to externally self -report on legal issues could be expected to"
pose significant consequences for attorney -client and other privileges.
•Th
"e Proposed Guidelines would require covered banks to create new systems, processes and"
protocols to meet expectations set out in the Proposed Guidelines.  The need for stakeholdersto have time to thoroughly review these requirements is particularly impo rtant as the ProposedFederal Deposit Insurance 
"Corporation  -3- November 8, 2023  "
"4878- 7202- 0879, v. 1Guidelines do not provide for a transition period to achieve compliance.  If adopted as "
"proposed, compliance would apparently be expected for covered banks on the effective date of the final guidelines.  "
•B
ecause the Proposed Guidelines include prescriptive requirements for the composition and
"duties of the bank board, stakeholders will need time to evaluate and consult with othersregarding the impact on FDIC -supervised banks in recruiting and retaining qu alified personne"
l
in
cluding directors.
Th
ese and other concerns are especially pronounced because the Proposed Guidelines are expressly 
intended to facilitate the agency’s ability to take enforcement actions when the Guidelines are 
breached.    
We are also requesting this extension given the extent to which comments on other outstanding 
proposals may relate to or affect comments on the Proposed Guidelines.  Given the recent extension of 
"the Basel III End Game comment period, we believe an extension is also warranted here to understand "
"its impact on the Proposed Guidelines  along with  the impact of  four  resolution -related  proposals ,2 which "
would alter the corporate governance framework at a fundamental level.  Stakeholders need additional 
time to achieve a more -informed and holistic understanding of the interplay between all these 
"proposals and their collective impact on FDIC -supervis ed banks, their customers, and the financial "
"system.  We also note that the current comment period includes the Thanksgiving holiday and the beginning of the period during which banks will undertake their year -end reporting obligations, both of "
which take away from banks’ abilities to respond fully to the Proposal.  
The additional requested time would enable banking organizations to provide more thorough 
comments and would support a more complete analysis of the cumulative costs and benefits of the 
pending proposals.
