the opportunity to comment on the notice of proposed rulemaking2 issued by the Office of 
"the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System, "
"and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (collectively, the “Agencies”) relating to "
computer-security incident not ification requirements for ba nking organizations and their 
bank service providers.  The Agencies’ thoughtfu l review and study of cybersecurity issues 
"is evident in the proposed rule, and the Asso ciations welcome this positive step toward "
achieving clarity and consistency in th e industry in this important area. 
"Like institutions thro ughout the public and pr ivate sectors, banking "
"organizations are reliant on interrelated computer  systems, and continue to be targeted in "
"cybersecurity attacks.  As such, our member s recognize the importan ce of timely detection "
"of significant cybersecurity threats, and fully  support the Agencies’ goa l of ensuring timely "
awareness of these threats in order to promote the safety a nd soundness of the U.S. financial 
"system.3  In that regard, we appreciate the Agen cies’ recognition that a requirement that "
banking organizations timely notify the Agencies  of critical cybersecurity incidents will 
represent the formalization of a vol untary practice that already exists.4 
The Associations also strongly suppor t the Agencies’ efforts to minimize 
the regulatory burden placed on banking organi zations addressing sign ificant cybersecurity 
"incidents, and to harmonize the proposed rule  with existing definitions and notification "
standards.5  Harmonization and other efforts to reduce additional burden will maximize 
banking organizations’ ability to focus in a crisis on protecting their customers and 
"restoring and ensuring the conf identiality, availability, and integrity of the systems on "
                                                 
2 Computer-Security Incident Notificati on Requirements for Banking Organizations 
"and Their Bank Service Providers, 86 Fed. Reg. 2299 (proposed Jan. 12, 2021) (to "
"be codified at 12 C.F.R. pt. 53; 12 C.F.R. pt. 225, 12 C.F.R. pt. 304). "

give the agencies earlier awareness of  emerging threats to individual banking 
"organizations and, potentially, to th e broader financial system[.]”); id. at 2302 "

would eventually notify their primary regul ator when an event occurs that meets

5 See id.  at 2303 (“This proposal is not exp ected to add signi ficant burden on 
banking organizations.”); id. at 2304 (describing that th e Agencies issued this 
proposed rule because existing “processes are not uniform or consistent between 
institutions and have not always resulted in timely notification being provided to 
the applicable regulator”).

which their services and operations depend.  We welcome the opportunity to collaborate 
with the Agencies on a rule that furthers  our shared interest in this regard. 
"While the Associations support many aspects of the proposed rule, we "
"believe change is warr anted in several areas, and we propos e revisions in those areas.  Our "
recommendations are intended to bring additi onal clarity and consis tency to the proposed 
"incident notification framework, to ensure the Agencies receive timely notification of the significant cybersecuri ty incidents that are the focus of the proposed rule, and to minimize "
"excess burden on banking organizations, including by avoiding unnecessary and burdensome over-reporting of less significant or easily remediated  matters not intended to "
be captured by the proposed rule.  We believe and intend that these proposed revisions will be workable for large and small institutions alike. 
I. Executive Summary 
 The Associations appreciate the Agencies’ efforts to ensure clarity and consistency 
in the reporting of signif icant cyber incidents while  minimizing the regulatory 
burden on banking organizations while respond ing to such incidents or otherwise 
in having to divert resour ces to unnecessary analysis  and over-reporting of less 
significant or easily remediated events. 
" While we support the policy goals of the propos ed rule, we believe that, as currently "
"drafted, the proposed rule calls for notific ation of incidents well below the intended "
"threshold of critical cybersecu rity incidents.  As a resu lt, the proposed rule would "
"lead to significant and burdensome over-re porting to the Agencies, contrary to its "
stated intention.  We provide recommendati ons that we believe will better achieve 
the shared goals of the Agencies and banking organizations in this context. 
" In particular, the Associati ons suggest that the final rule reflect the following "
changes with respect to the notificati on requirements for banking organizations:
6 
o The title of the rule should be chan ged from “Computer-Security Incident 
Notification” to reflect the rule’s more limited scope and purpose. 
o The definition of “notification incident” should be revised. 
 The notification requirement shoul d include only those incidents 
that result in “actual” harm and that a banking organization 
“determines” in good faith are “r easonably likely ” to cause the 
significant harms set forth in the rule. 
 The notification requirement should be limited to information 
"systems that carry out banking opera tions, activities, or processes, "
                                                 
6 The Associations’ suggested revisions to the text of th e proposed rule are set forth 
in their entirety in Annex B.  
 -4- 
 
or deliver banking products or servic es in the ordinary course of 
"business, and should clarify that notification concerning material "
"loss to a business line of revenue, profit or franchise value is only "
required if such loss is to the enterprise as a whole. 
o The examples of notification incidents should be further clarified to provide 
guidance to banking organizations. 
o The proposed 36-hour timeframe for notif ication will not be achievable or 
workable unless: 
 The definition of “notification in cident” is tailored as set forth 
above; 
 The rule incorporates the shared view of the Agencies and banking 
organizations that it may require  a reasonable amount of time for 
banking organizations to determine whether they have experienced 
a notification incident; 
 The timeframe is modified to require notification as soon as 
“practicable” but no later th an 36 hours after the banking 
organization “determines” in good fa ith that a notification incident 
has occurred; and 
 The rule incorporates the shared view of the Agencies and banking 
organizations that notification ne ed not include an assessment of 
the incident. 
o The rule should permit banking organizations to provide notice through any 
of multiple potential channels. 
"o We welcome additional clar ity on aspects of the pos t-notification process, "
"including whether and to what extent the Agencies intend to share information provided in connection with  a notification, how they intend to "
"secure such information, and how they will ensure that examiners minimize excess burden on banking organizations dealing with potentially critical "
incidents. 
"o The definition of “banking organization”  should be revise d, including to "
"add new financial services entities,  such as non-bank OCC-chartered "
financial technology companies. 
 We support the Agencies’ efforts to hold ba nk service providers accountable to the 
"banking organizations they serve, and to require them to provide prompt "
"notification of disruptive in cidents.  In that regar d, we recommend the following "
modifications to the bank service provider notification requirement:  
 -5- 
 
o The proposed rule should be revised to allow for service providers to satisfy 
their notification requirement by provi ding notification to their banking 
organization customers consistent with any requirements and by any 
"methods set forth by contract with th at customer, so long as the method "
reasonably ensures that the banking orga nization receives the notification. 
o The rule should require notification to be made where the bank service 
"provider “determines” in good faith that a computer-security incident is “reasonably likely” to “materially” disr upt, degrade, or impair the relevant "
activities for four or more hours. 
"o The final rule should codify the Ag encies’ view, as articulated in the "
"Preamble, that banking organizations w ould not be cited for the failure of a "
bank service provider to comply with the rule. 
o Subsidiaries and affiliates should be excluded from the definition of “bank 
service provider” for purpos es of the proposed rule. 
 The rule should take effect no earlier th an the first day of the calendar quarter 
beginning on or after 90 days follo wing publication of the final rule. 
II. Discussion of Comments on the Proposed Rule 
A. Title of the Rule 
We propose changing the title of the rule  from “Computer-Security Incident 
"Notification” to reflect the more limited set of incidents that would require notification under the rule, and we welcome the opportunity to work with the Agencies on devising a "
"title.  A change in nomenclature is important, in our view, in light of the rule’s 36-hour "
"timeframe for notification, which is significan tly shorter than any existing cyber breach "
"notification requirement in the industry.  As set forth below, the rule’s 36-hour timeframe "
"will only be achievable, in our view, if the Agencies adopt the changes proposed herein.  "
In the event that other regulat ory bodies consider any notific ation timeframe as short as 
"that in the proposed rule, we believe it is impe rative that the rule be clear, including from "
"its title, that it is limited to a narrow set of incidents, so that the adoption of this timeframe not be misperceived as achievable outside this limited context.  “Computer-Security "
"Incident Notification,” by cont rast, suggests a much broader set of incidents would be "
subject to notification under the rule than the rule actually requires. 
B. The Definition of “Com puter-Security Incident” 
The proposed rule defines “computer-secu rity incident” as  “an occurrence 
"that: (i) Results in actual or potential harm to  the confidentiality, integrity, or availability "
"of an information system or the information that the system processes, stores, or transmits; "
"or (ii) Constitutes a violation or  imminent threat of violation of security policies, security  "
 -6- 
 
"procedures, or acceptable use policies.”7  The Associations acknowledge and appreciate "
that the Agencies sought to align this term w ith an existing term from  the National Institute 
"of Standards and Technology (“NIST”).  As a ge neral matter, we believe that the existing "
NIST definition is overbroad for purposes of the rule.  Consistent with the fact that the 
"definition is not intended as a notification standard, the term “computer-security incident” "
"captures a large volume of insignificant, everyda y occurrences that will never rise to the "
"level of a notification incident.  We believe, how ever, that the term will be workable in the "
"proposed rule so long as the de finition of “notification incide nt” is more narrowly tailored, "
"as we propose below, to ach ieve the rule’s objectives.8 "
C. The Definition of “N otification Incident” 
The proposed rule defines “notificati on incident” as “a computer-security 
"incident that a banking orga nization believes in good fait h could materially disrupt, "
"degrade, or impair— (i) The ability of th e banking organization to carry out banking "
"operations, activities, or proce sses, or deliver banking products and services to a material "
"portion of its customer base, in the ordinary c ourse of business; (ii) Any business line of a "
"banking organization, including as sociated operations, services , functions and support, and "
"would result in a material lo ss of revenue, profit, or franchise value; or (iii) Those "
"operations of a banking organiza tion, including associated services, functions and support, "
"as applicable, the failure or discontinuance of  which would pose a thr eat to the financial "
stability of the United States.”9  The Associations recognize and appreciate the Agencies’ 
stated goal in drafting this definition to “minimize compliance burden by focusing only on 
"events that are likely to cause significant harm to banking organizations,” and to create "
"only a “ de minimis ” regulatory burden, which is essentia l for any institution addressing a "
"significant cybersecurity incident impacti ng its customers, services, operations or "
industry.10  We also appreciate the Agencies’ re quest for comment as to whether this 
definition should be modified. 
"While we support the policy goals of the proposed definition, we believe "
"the definition should be tailored, consistent  with the Agencies’ intention, to avoid a "

Reg. at 2311. 
"8 The Associations emphasize, however, that  if the NIST definition, which is the "
"subject of ongoing discussion and analysis, is  revised in the future, its definition "
within this rule should also be revised to maintain harmonization.

 -7- 
 
significant compliance burden on banking organi zations in the form of over-reporting of 
"less significant or easily remedi ated events.  For the reasons  set forth below, we propose "
revising the definition of “notif ication incident” as follows:  “Notification incident is a 
computer-security incident that: (a) Results in actual harm to an information system that 
"carries out banking operations, activities, or pr ocesses, or delivers banking products or "
services in the ordinary course of business;  and (b) A banking organization determines in 
"good faith is reasonably likely to  materially disrupt, degrade, or impair— (i) The ability of "
"the banking organization to carry out banking opera tions, activities, or processes, or deliver "
"banking products and services to a material por tion of its customer base, in the ordinary "
"course of business;  (ii) Any business line of a banking organization, including associated "
"operations, services, functions and support, and would result, on an enterprise-wide basis, "
"in a material loss of revenue, profit, or franchise value; or  (iii) Those operations of a "
"banking organization, including asso ciated services, functions and support, as applicable, "
the failure or discontinuance of which would pose  a threat to the financial stability of the 
United States.” 
We believe this proposed definition will achieve the Agencies’ goals while 
avoiding unnecessary burden and expense for banking organizations and the Agencies.  In 
"addition, we believe this definition will better harmonize the rule with banking "
"organizations’ existing, volunt ary notification practices. "
1. The notification requirement should be tailored to an incident 
that results in actual  harm and that a banking organization 
determines in good faith is re asonably likely to cause the 
significant harms set forth in the rule. 
"First , we propose limiting the notification threshold to an occurrence that "
results in “actual” harm and that  the banking organization “determines”  in good faith is 
“reasonably likely”  to cause the significant harms set forth in the rule.  We believe this 
definition captures the full sc ope of incidents about whic h the Agencies seek early 
"notification, while avoiding notif ication of innumerable, less significant incidents that are "
implied by the existing definition of “notif ication incident” in the proposed rule. 
"Specifically, as currently drafted, the proposed rule requires notification of "
any occurrence that results only in “potential ” harm (since “computer-security incident” is 
defined in part as an occurrence that result s in potential harm) and that the organization 
"believes merely “could” cause the significant harms set forth in the rule.  A notification requirement that includes “ potential” harm, however, woul d capture occurrences of no "
consequence or utility in the proposed repo rting framework that occur dozens or even 
hundreds of times a day at instit utions across industries that would never result in the type 
"of institution-wide or systemic impact cont emplated by the proposed rule.  For example, "
"“potential” harm can be seen in garden-var iety attempted bad acts by outsiders, including "
"phishing emails and unsuccessf ul attempts to guess account passwords, among others; "
"careless acts by an individual insider, includi ng the loss of a securely password-protected "
"laptop or mobile device, among others; insignif icant software issues that institutions  "
 -8- 
 
address through automatic updates; and other fre quent occurrences that result in no actual 
harm. 
"Further, defining “notification incident ” to include any such incident that "
"“could”  materially disrupt, degrade, or impair certain significant activities, as set forth in "
"the proposed rule, would inadvert ently sweep up and require notification of countless less "
significant or easily remediated incidents because the majority of such incidents will pose at least a theoretical  possibility of having a material impact—even if that possibility is 
"highly remote and improbable.  For example,  a banking organization may promptly detect "
"and remediate attempted unauthorized activity in certain accounts, or the compromise of "
"an employee’s email account in a phishing sc heme, but the harms posed by such incidents "
“could” theoretically persist a nd be leveraged to cause greate r harm despite a lack of any 
evidence and no reason to believ e that they have done so. 
"To avoid over-reporting, the Associati ons propose tailori ng the notification "
requirement to incidents that result in some  “actual” harm that banking organizations 
“determine” in good faith are “reasonably likely ” to result in the signi ficant harms set forth 
in the rule.  Incorporating this “reasonabl e likelihood” threshold w ill meet the goal of 
providing the Agencies with an early warni ng wherever a banking organization determines 
that such a harm may realistically occur.  The Associations also propose replacing the word 
"“believe” with the word “determine,” which bett er captures the analytical process that must "
generally be undertaken by a ba nking organization before it can reasonably conclude that 
"a notification incident has occurred, and which is used by the Agencies in the Preamble "
"(e.g., “[t]he proposed rule would require bank ing organizations to notify their primary "
federal regulator as soon as possible and no later than 36 hour s after a banking organization 
has determined  that a notification in cident has occurred”).
11 
2. The notification requirement should be more clearly defined 
with respect to the type of in formation systems and significant 
harms at issue. 
The Associations believe that the no tification requirement should also be 
more clearly defined with respect to the type  of information systems and significant harms 
"at issue.  Specifically, the re quirement should be limited to t hose information systems that "
"may actually give rise to an incident of the type the Agencies are concerned about, that is, "
"those that carry out ba nking operations, activities, or pro cesses, or deliver banking products "
"or services in the ordinary c ourse of business.  In our view , this delineation will achieve "
the Agencies’ goal of ensuring timely notifica tion of any “significant computer-security 
"incident that could jeopardize the viability of the operations of an individual banking organization, result in customers being unabl e to access their deposit and other accounts, "
or impact the stability of the financial sector”
12 because it includes the information systems 
"of banking organizations that coul d give rise to such an inci dent.  At the same time, we "
                                                 
"11 Id. at 2304 (emphasis added); see also id. at 2302–05, 2307–08. "
12 Id. at 2301.  
 -9- 
 
believe the delineation avoids unnecessarily cap turing myriad internal systems of banking 
organizations that have no effect on banking organizations’ ability to  provide products or 
"services to customers, the banking organization’ s financial strength, or the stability of the "
"financial system.  For example, marketing sy stems and systems in which employee data is "
"stored are information systems, but harm to these systems would not, by itself, result in "
any significant harm that is the focus of the proposed rule. 
"Separately, the proposed rule includ es among notification incidents those "
"that could materially disrupt, degrade or  impair “[a]ny business line of a banking "
"organization, including associated operations , services, functions and support, and would "
"result in a material loss of reve nue, profit, or franchise value.”13  The Associations believe "
"this category of reportable in cidents should be narrowed to  those that would, “on an "
"enterprise-wide basis,” result in a material lo ss of revenue, profit, or franchise value.  "
"Without this clarifying language, the rule may be construed to require notification to the "
"Agencies of incidents that materially aff ect the value of any business line, including "
business lines that may be small and immateri al to the overall banki ng organization.  The 
Associations believe that such a broad requirement would be inconsistent with the intention 
of the proposed rule. 
3. The examples of notification incidents require further 
clarification to provide mean ingful guidance to banking 
organizations. 
"Finally, while we appreciate that the Agencies have provided examples of "
"incidents that would constitute notification incidents, we believe that some of the examples require additional detail to provide mean ingful guidance, and otherwise would not "
necessarily meet the high threshold for notific ation that is intended by the Agencies.  For 
"example, while the first example, involving a distributed denial of service attack that "
"disrupts access to customer accounts, is lim ited to attacks causing disruption “for an "
"extended period of time ( e.g., more than 4 hours),” the third, sixth and seventh examples "
(“[a] failed system upgrade or change that resu lts in widespread user outages for customers 
"and bank employees,” “[m]alwa re propagating on a banking or ganization’s network that "
"requires the banking organization to disengage all internet-based ne twork connections,” "
"and “[a] ransom malware att ack that encrypts a core banking system or backup data,” "
respectively) do not currently include any lim itation as to the length of time of disruption 
that would give rise to  a notification incident.
"14  From the customer’s perspective, however, "
each of these incidents re sults in the same disruption of ac cess to bank accounts or services.  
"In addition, as to each of these examples, bank ing organizations may be able to remediate "
"and resume operations promptly.  For thes e reasons, we believe each example should "
                                                 
"13  Proposed 12 C.F.R. pt. 53.2(b)(5)(ii) , 86 Fed. Reg. at 2310; proposed 12 C.F.R. "
"pt. 225.301(a), 86 Fed. Reg. at 2310; proposed  12 C.F.R. pt. 304.22(b)(5)(ii), 86 "
Fed. Reg. at 2311. 
14 See 86 Fed. Reg. at 2302.  
 -10- 
 
"include, at a minimum, the same limitation that  the disruption persists  “for an extended "
"period of time ( e.g., more than 4 hours),” and we woul d welcome further discussion about "
"limiting the examples to those for which there is no near-term path to recovery for the institution.  In addition, the example involving ransomware should be limited not only to "
"attacks that result in encryption of core syst ems or data for an extended period of time, but "
as to which no backup system is available for an extended period of time. 
In determining whether an incident rises to the level of a notification 
"incident, banking organizations may consider  other existing and potentially relevant "
"regulatory and industry standard s including capital and liquidity  standards, or whether the "
"occurrence constitutes a She ltered Harbor event, among ot hers.  We welcome further "
discussion with the Agencies as to how ba nking organizations will assess the significance 
of the impact of potential  notification incidents. 
D. The 36-Hour Timeframe for Notification 
The Associations appreciate the importa nce of early detection of significant 
"cybersecurity incidents, and support the goal of ensuring early de tection of emerging "
threats to individual banking organizations a nd the broader financia l system.  We also 
"appreciate the Agencies’ acknowledgment th at, in requiring banki ng organizations to "
provide notification “as soon as possible and no later than  36 hours” after making a good 
"faith determination that a notification incident has occurred,"
15 the proposed rule would 
"impose time-sensitive affirmative requireme nts on a banking organization, diverting "
crucial resources at the moment that the organi zation is responding to a significant security 
"incident.16  For a 36-hour notification timeframe to be potentially workable and achievable, "
"it is imperative that the scope of the notification requirement be tailored as we have proposed above, and as further set forth below,  to more closely align with the Agencies’ "
limited intent in promulgating the rule. 
1. The definition of “notification in cident” should be revised as set 
forth herein. 
"As set forth above, we believe the te rm “notification incident” should be "
"defined more precisely, as we have proposed  above, to avoid unnecessary and burdensome "
"over-reporting.  Without these changes, the Associations do not believe the 36-hour "
timeframe is achievable or workable given th e significant volume of incidents that would 
potentially constitute “notification incidents”  under the proposed rule as drafted.  With 
                                                 
"15  See proposed 12 C.F.R. pt. 53.3, 86 Fed. Re g. at 2310; proposed 12 C.F.R. pt. "
"225.303, 86 Fed. Reg. at 2310; proposed 12 C.F.R. pt. 304.23, 86 Fed. Reg. at "
2311. 
16 See 86 Fed. Reg. at 2303 (“The agencies recognize that a banking organization 
may be working expeditiously to resolve the notification incident—either directly 
or through a bank service provider—at the tim e it would be expected to notify its 
primary federal regulator.”).  
 -11- 
 
"these changes, however, and the others noted  below, we believe the 36-hour timeframe "
would be both achievable and workable. 
"Additionally, in light of the new sta ndard that the 36 -hour notification "
"timeframe represents for the i ndustry, we think it is critical to tailor the definition of "
“notification incident” to the limited set of in cidents that the Agencies intend to capture.  
To the extent any other re gulatory bodies might consid er a 36-hour timeframe for 
"notification, it is critical that th e language of this rule be precis e as to its narrow application, "
because we believe this notific ation timeframe is not achievable or workable for banking 
organizations outside of this limited context. 
"2. The final rule should codify the Agencies’ view, as set forth in "
"the Preamble, that banking organizations may take a reasonable amount of time to determine whether a computer-security incident is a “notification incident.” "
We appreciate and support the Agencies’ statement that they “do not expect 
that a banking organization would typically be able to determine that a notification incident 
"has occurred immediately upon becoming aware of  a computer-security incident.  Rather, "
the Agencies anticipate that a banking organi zation would take a re asonable amount of 
time to determine that it has experienced a notification incident.”
17  As the Agencies 
"recognize, it typically requires re view or investigation to dete rmine the significance of any "
"cybersecurity incident.  For that reason, and to avoid over-reporting to the Agencies of "
incidents found to fall below the notificatio n threshold after appropriate review or 
"investigation is performed, we believe it is crit ical that banking orga nizations have comfort "
"that they can conduct such revi ew or investigation, consistent  with the rule’s notification "
"requirements, before determining that a notific ation incident has occurred.  In particular, "
the rule should incorporate the statement th at after becoming aware of the potential 
"occurrence of a notific ation incident, “the banking organization ma y take a reasonable "
"amount of time to determine whether it has, in fact, experienced a notification incident.” "
"Additionally, we appreciate the Agencies’ use of the term “determine” in "
the Preamble with respect to a banking orga nization’s conclusion that a notification 
"incident has occurred ( i.e., the 36-hour time period begins running “after a banking "
organization has determined  that a notification incident has occurred”)18 and we

"organization,” as opposed to any particular employee, has conclude d that a significant "
cybersecurity incident has occurred.  The nature  and scope of cybersecurity incidents often 
do not manifest in immediatel y discernible or verifiable  ways.  Use of the word 
"“determine” rather than “believe” would better  capture the concept that appropriate review, "
"investigation, internal discussion and/or anal ysis is typically required before a banking "
organization can conclude that any notification incident has occurred. 
"In this regard, we believe it is also im portant for the final rule to address an "
"apparent misconception in the cost assessment of the proposed rule, which estimates that "
"after a notification incident ha s occurred, and before notifying  the Agencies, the incident "
"may need to be escalated to and discusse d with, and the response may need to be "
"coordinated among, senior intern al stakeholders such as th e Chief Information Officer "
"(“CIO”), Chief Information Security Officer  (“CISO”), a senior legal or compliance "
"officer, and staff of a bank service provider, as  applicable, as well as senior management.  "
"Depending on the circumstances, a nd for banking organizations that  rely on external parties "
"to fulfill certain key stakeholder functions, it may be necessary for the banking organization "
"to consult external counsel, cybersecurity fi rms, and other subject-matter experts.  The "
proposed rule estimates that this proce ss of notifying key stakeholders will take 
"approximately three hours.20  In banking organizations’ experience, however, there are "
"circumstances in which one employee, includin g any of the senior internal stakeholders "
"identified by the Agencies, may conclude that  a particular incident has occurred, while "
another (including any of the external subject-matter experts upon whom the banking 
organization may rely) may have questions or require follow-up work that indicates that 
"such an incident has not occurred, is not signi ficant, is easily remedied, or does not have "
"particular legal or regulatory significance.  In  other words, it is not always the case that key "
stakeholders and advisers are merely apprised of the conclusion that a notification incident 
"has occurred, such that their involvement entails merely three hours within a 36-hour "
"timeframe for notification.  Inst ead, the participation of these key stakeholders and advisers "
is in many cases crucial to the very determ ination of whether a no tification incident has 
occurred such that the 36-hour timeframe can  begin to run.  We believe the Preamble and 
cost assessment should be revised to clarify this point. 
3. The proposed rule should be modi fied to allow for notification 
as soon as “practicable” but no  later than 36 hours after the 
banking organization determines in good faith that a notification incident has occurred. 	
We propose that the rule be modified to allow for notification as soon as 
"“practicable,” instead of  as soon as “possible,”  but no later than 36 hours after the banking "
"organization determines in good faith that a notif ication incident has occurred, and that the "
Agencies acknowledge in the Preamble that  the time required to make a good faith 
determination that a notification incident has occurred may vary by banking organization 
and depending on the circumstances.  The time required to make such a good faith 
                                                 
20  86 Fed. Reg. at 2304.

"determination will natura lly vary by banking organi zation, including between "
"organizations that differ in si ze and available resources.  Th e term “practicable,” in our "
"view, better captures that concept, avoi ding any misperception that because one "
organization was able to conclude in a particul ar timeframe that a not ification incident has 
"occurred, it was “possible” that other organi zations could have done so as well.  By "
"including this term, and the related acknowledgment in the Preamble, banking "
organizations will have comfort that as long as they report as soon as practicable for the 
organization and no later than 36 hours after determ ining that a notification incident has 
"occurred, they will be in compliance with the rule even if another organization may have "
reached such a conclusion in a shorter timeframe. 
4. The rule should incorporate the shared view of the agencies and 
banking organizations that notification need not include an assessment of the incident. 
The Associations strongl y support the Agencies’ determination that “the 
notice would not need to include an asse ssment of the incident” or any specific 
information.
21  We believe that simplicity of the notification is critical to the effectiveness 
"of the rule and, in particular, to the wo rkability of a short 36-hour timeframe for "
notification.  It is our view that requiri ng any specific information or assessment would 
"result in a complex, uncertain, and burdensom e process at a sensitive time.  Given the "
"significance of this issue for banking organizations, we believe it is important to incorporate this conclusion into the text of the rule itself. "
E. The Notification Process 
We appreciate the Agencies’ solici tation of comments on the method of 
"notification to the Agencies, and that the propos ed rule already incorporates a degree of "
flexibility by allowing for notification through  either written or oral communication.  
"Rather than requiring notification solely to a single, agency-designate d point of contact, "
"however, we believe that providing banking organizations with multiple options for "
"providing notification will best ensure that th e Agencies receive timely notification, and in "
a manner that imposes a de minimis  burden on institutions re sponding to a significant 
cybersecurity incident.
22 
1. The rule should provide banking organizations with multiple 
options for notifying the Agencies. 
We agree with the Agencies’ decisi on to allow notification through any 
"technological means, but believe it is also critical to provide our members with multiple "
potential channels of communi cation of notification incidents.  We recommend that the 
"final rule provide that notif ication may be satisfied by an y of several methods, including, "
                                                 
21 Id. at 2303. 
"22 See id. at 2305, 2307.  "
 -14- 
 
"if applicable, notice to any me mber of the banking organiza tion’s on-site or  supervisory "
"team by any medium, notice to the regional office of the pertinent regulator, or notice to "
an agency-designated point of contact.  We also recommend that the individuals to be 
contacted be mutually ag reed upon by the parties. 
"During a disruptive incident, some ch annels of communication may not be "
"operational or secure.  Additi onally, a banking organization may determine that it has "
"experienced a notificatio n incident during a holiday, at the start of a weekend, or at other "
times during which any particular method may be less desirable or any designated agency 
representative may be unavailable.  Permittin g notification to any of several points of 
contact and through multiple channels would he lp ensure that the Agencies receive the 
"notification timely, and would reduce the burde n on any banking organization in the event "
that a single designated point of contact were unavailable. 
2. Post-notification communications and information-sharing 
should prioritize security and minimizing the burden on banking organizations. 
Given the critical need for banking organizations to focus resources on 
"response and recovery, and the Agen cies’ intention to impose only a de minimis  burden in "
"this context, we believe the Agencies should prioritize minimizing the burden on banking "
"organizations in post-notification communications.  For example, it will minimize the burden on banking organizations if they can set the cadence of post-notification "
"communications after notif ication of an ongoing incident.  Fu rther, we believe that for the "
"rule to operate as intended, it is critical th at the Agencies communicate to examiners their "
"stated intention, and the im portance, of minimizing burde n on banking organizations in "
"this context, and that  examiners adhere to that intention.  We we lcome the opportunity to "
discuss this issue further with the Agencies. 
We also welcome further discussion a bout how the Agencies intend to share 
and secure any information provided by a banking organization in connection with a 
"notification incident, an issue of critical importance to our members.  For example, banking "
organizations would appreciate further clarity on how the Agencies envision securing the 
"information once it has been received, and whether and under what circumstances the "
Agencies would share the information with othe r authorities.  Given the sensitivity of the 
"subject matter, we believe that notifications  and any related information provided by a "
banking organization pursuant to  the rule should be treated as confidential supervisory 
information that will not be made public. 
F. The Definition of “Banking Organization” 
We appreciate the Agencies’ request for comments on the types of regulated 
entities that should be subject to the rule as “banking organi zations.”  The definition of 
"“banking organization” should in clude new financial services  entities, including non-bank "
OCC-chartered financial technology companies.   Notification incidents at such entities 
could result in systemic or disruptive effect s similar to those at other types of banking  
 -15- 
 
"organizations, and information provided to th e Agencies by these entities may assist the "
Agencies in supervising and advising  other types of banking organizations.23 
III. Bank Service Provider Notification 
The proposed rule provides that a ba nk service provider “is required to 
notify at least two indi viduals at each affected banking organization customer immediately 
after the bank service provider experiences a com puter security incident that it believes in 
"good faith could disrupt, degrade, or impair services  provided, subject to the Bank Service "
Company Act . . . for four or more hours.”24  The Associations appreciate the Agencies’ 
"recognition, in formulating this requirement , of the important role that bank service "
providers serve in the security of the banki ng system.  We also support the Agencies’ 
efforts to ensure bank service providers’ accoun tability and notification to their banking 
"organization customers about di sruptive cybersecurity incident s, and their stated goal of "
minimizing the burden on banking organizations and bank service pr oviders in this process.  
We also appreciate the statement in the Prea mble that the Agencies would not cite a 
banking organization because a serv ice provider fails to comply  with the service provider 
notification requirement.25 
"Contrary to the Agencies’ intention,  we believe the proposed notification "
requirement would significantly increase the burden on banking organizations and their 
service providers.  We propose revisions inte nded to provide further clarity on the nature 
and scope of the notification ob ligation in order to  avoid this unintended consequence.  
A. The Role of Contracts in the Notification Process 
We understand from the Preamble that the Agencies would like to better 
understand the role that contracts play in en suring that banking organi zations receive notice 
of incidents from bank service providers.  We appreciate that  the Agencies have requested 
"feedback on this issue, and ag ree with the Agencies that the existence of contractual "
                                                 
23  The Associations also recommend that the Agencies exclude from the proposed 
definition of “banking organization” any sy stemically important financial market 
utility (“SIFMU”) for which the SEC is the Supervisory Agency under Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act.  The SEC’s role as the primary rulemaking authority should 
be respected in connection with the development of technology incident 
"management and notification standards.  This is especially true in an area where, as "
"in the case of Regulation SCI, the SEC has promulgated robust and effective regulatory requirements which would allow it to  meet the objectives set forth in this "
Proposal.

obligations between banking organizations and service providers impacts the utility of the 
proposed rule. 
The Agencies correctly state that “m any existing contracts between banking 
organizations and bank service providers contain notification provisions regarding material 
incidents.”26  These contracts frequently establish the method of notification.  The 
"threshold and substance of what must be re ported and the method of notification, as set "
"forth in these contractual requirements, di ffers across banking organizations, and may "
differ within a banking organization.  Factors that affect these differences include the 
"nature of the service provider and its signifi cance to the bank, how the relevant departments "
"or divisions of the bank operate, the preex isting relationship betw een the bank and its "
"service provider, and industry custom and pract ice with respect to the services at issue. "
Many of our members are comfortable with the nature and scope of the 
"contractual notification require ments imposed on their servi ce providers, and the processes "
"they have established for cont ractual notification to be pr ovided.  Importantly, many have "
drafted and negotiated these contracts in accord ance with banks’ obligations for third party 
risk management under existing interagency guidelines.27  T o  c o m p l y  w i t h  t h e s e  
"guidelines, many banks have had to establish co ntractual expectations that address, among "
"other things, breach notification requiremen ts, including as to scope and timing, in a "
manner that is appropriate to the risk presen ted and taking into accoun t the nature of the 
relationship.  We believe that the rule shou ld not supplant the cont ractual expectations 
"these banks have carefully set fort h in contracts, in part to m eet their regulatory obligations.  "
"Doing so would impose a significant and unnecessary burden on these institutions, "
requiring them to renegotiate provisions that may number into the dozens or hundreds and 
that otherwise already meet the shared goals of the Agencies and ba nking organizations in 
"this area.  For example, many banking organizat ions contractually requ ire service providers "
to provide notice of cybersecurity incidents using a different mechanism than the proposed 
"rule’s method of notifying two individuals of  the banking organiza tion.  For instance, "
banking organizations may require service pr oviders to report in cidents through two 
"methods  (e.g., an incident response hotline and em ail) rather than to two specific "
individuals. 
"For these reasons, we request that the proposed rule be revised to "
incorporate flexibility for the la rge group of institutions that manage these notifications by 
"contract.  Specifically, the proposed rule shoul d be revised to allow for service providers "
to satisfy their notification requirement by pr oviding notification to their banking customer

consistent with any requirements and by any me thods set forth in thei r contract with that 
"customer, so long as the method reasonably en sures that the banking organization receives "
"the notification.  Accordingly, we recommend that the final rule require bank service providers “to notify each affected banking organization customer, in a manner that "
"reasonably ensures that the banking organization receives the notification, after the bank service provider experien ces” a relevant incident. "
B. Nature and Scope of Notification Requirement 
We appreciate the Agencies’ request fo r comments as to whether the bank 
service provider notifi cation requirement should be limited in nature and scope in order to 
“only attach to a subset of services provi ded to banking organizations under the BSCA” or 
"“to certain bank service providers, such as t hose that are examined by the federal banking "
Agencies.”
28  We believe the proposed rule should be  revised in this regard in order to 
avoid the risk that bank service providers s ubstantially over-report.  Over-reporting would 
"create unnecessary burden not only for servi ce providers, but for banking organizations, "
which may need to respond to  such notifications by undert aking further assessment and 
analysis of the incident in order to asse ss the level of risk pos ed by the occurrence. 
"In addition, as with the proposed defi nition of “notifica tion incident,” the "
requirement that service providers report  any computer-security  incident that “ could  
"disrupt, degrade or impair serv ices for four or more hours”29 can be expected to lead to "
substantial over-reporting of less significant or easily remediated occurrences.  The risk of such over-reporting is heighten ed by the proposed re quirement that the service provider’s 
notification be made “immedi ately.”  While banking organi zations encourage immediate 
"notification, we believe that the utility of that requirement depends upon the nature and "
quality of the notifications provided.  We understand that bank service providers 
"recommend that the rule requi re notification “timely,” as opposed to “immediately,” to "
enable them to assess the severity of a comput er-security incident and minimize the risk of 
"unnecessary notifications.  We note, in addi tion, that certain banks and bank service "
providers have effective contractual provisi ons governing the timing of notification.  We 
"anticipate further discussion among banking orga nizations, bank service providers, and the "
Agencies to achieve a standard that achieves our shared goals and is workable for all parties. 
"Accordingly, the Associations beli eve the following revisions should be "
made to the service provider  notification requirements:

" First , bank service providers should be requi red to provide notice of reportable "
incidents that they determine in good faith  are “reasonably likely” to “materially” 
"disrupt, degrade, or impair the releva nt services for four or more hours; "
" Second , the notification requirement should be limited to critical services and bank "
service providers.  We s upport the Agencies’ suggestio n that the rule may be 
limited to services or providers subject to specific supervisory programs to achieve the policy aims of the proposed rule w ithout overburdening banking organizations 
and bank service providers with immaterial  notifications.  Programs that might be 
"considered, but would require further discussion and anal ysis, include the "
Significant Service Provider  (“SSP”) Program for system ically important third-
"party service providers, and the Shared Application Software Review (“SASR”) "
"Program, which generally examines purch ased software that involves mission-"
"critical, core, or high-risk applications widely used at financial institutions."
30 
C. Enforcement 
The Associations appreciate the Agen cies’ statement in the Preamble that 
banking organizations will not be cited for the failure of a bank service provider to comply with the rule.
"31  Given the importance of this statem ent to our members, we request that "
the final rule incorporate the statement th at “an affected banki ng organization is not 
"responsible for the failure of a bank service provi der to comply with this part.”  Relatedly, "
we understand that it will be unnecessary for banking organizations to modify their 
contracts to reference enforcement of the rule  given the Agencies’ intention to enforce the 
rule directly against bank service providers. 
D. Definition of “Bank Service Provider” 
"Finally, we appreciate that the Agen cies have requested comments on the "
proposed definition of “bank service provider. ”  The Associations recommend that banking 
organization subsidiaries and affiliates be expressly exempt from the “bank service 
provider” definition.  These entities already fo llow internal escalation processes to alert 
"parent banking organizations to potential reportable incidents,  and, as the Preamble to the "
"proposed rule notes that these entities shoul d continue doing so, th eir inclusion in the "
definition would be redundant.  Their inclusi on would also create an  unnecessary potential 
"burden on them to revise their existing, well -functioning processes to the extent those "
processes differ from those set forth in the rule.  We would suggest that the revised

definition provide as follows:  “Bank service provider means a bank service company or 
other person providing services to a banki ng organization that is subject to the Bank 
"Service Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1861–1867), except that banking organization "
subsidiaries and affiliates are excluded from the de finition of bank serv icer provider for 
the purposes of this part .” 
The Associations also recommend that the Agencies exclude from the 
proposed definition of “bank service provider”  financial market utilities (“FMUs”) as 
defined by the Dodd-Frank Act.  Such entities have existing practices of providing timely 
notice to their primary federal regulator and bank customers of operational incidents.  An 
FMU’s direct notice to its primary federal regulator meets the Agencies’ objectives set forth in the proposed rule in the mo st efficient and least burdensome way. 
IV. Implementation 
The Associations request that the propos ed rule take effect no earlier than 
the first day of the calendar quarter beginning on or after 90 days following the publication 
date of the final rule.  This timeframe would allow our member s to take any necessary steps 
"to prepare to comply with the rule.  Further, when the final rule is promulgated, the Associations encourage the Agencies to comm unicate the promulgation of the final rule "
broadly to both banking organiza tions and bank service providers.

The Associations appreciate the opportunity to comment on the notice of 
"proposed rulemaking.  We intend to continue jo intly discussing the proposed rule, and look "
forward to engaging in discussion with the Agencies in the post-comment period on the 
areas of the proposed rule th at require further clarity.
