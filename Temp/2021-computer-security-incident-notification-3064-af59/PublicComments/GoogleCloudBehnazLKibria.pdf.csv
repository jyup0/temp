Intr oduction
Effecti v e incident response is critical for the financial
ser vices industr y .  As a pro vider of  cloud
"ser vices to the financial ser vices industr y , Google"
Cloud maintains a rig orous process for prev enting
and managing data incidents as par t of  our o v erall
security and pri v acy prog ram.  W e also believ e
1
strongly in suppor ting the establishment of  effecti v e regulator y framew orks g o v er ning incident
response .  T he Incident Notification R equirements
proposed b y the Banking R egulators are an
impor tant initiati v e in that reg ard.
W e offer belo w some responses to the questions presented
b y the Banking R egulators reg arding the
proposed Incident Notification R equirements and the
state of  pla y on incident response in the
industr y .  A n umber of  high lev el principles infor m
our responses:
1.
An impor tant aspect of  an effecti v e incident response
process is ensuring that tr ue
positi v es/material incidents are f lag g ed to affected
customers and that these are not
dro wned out b y false positi v es/non-material incidents .
"T his helps bank ser vice pro viders ,"
"banking org anizations , and, ultimately , regulators"
focus on the incidents that matter and not
expend resources on false or
de minimis
matters .
2.
Some amount of  reasonable in v estig ation is usually
required to distinguish tr ue
positi v es/material incidents from false positi v es/non-material
incidents .
3.
V oluntar y fora for infor mation sharing about threats/incidents
are impor tant and should be
"considered, instead of  incident notification, for"
pur poses of  raising g eneral industr y
a w areness and sensiti vity .
Google Cloud offers belo w a n umber of  sug g estions
to shape the Incident Notification
R equirements in line with these principles .

R esponses to Questions Pr esented
1.
How should the definition of  ‘‘computer-security incident’’
"be modified, if  at all? F or"
"example , should it include onl y occur rences tha t result"
in actual har m to the
"confidentiality , integrity , or availability of  an"
infor mation system or the infor mation
"the system pr ocesses , stores , or transmits? Should"
it include onl y occur rences tha t
"constitute an actual viola tion of  security policies ,"
"security pr ocedures , or acce ptable use"
policies?
T he proposed Incident Notification R equirements define
“computer -security incident” as “an
occur rence that: (1) results in actual or potential
"har m to the confidentiality , integ rity , or a v ailability"
of  an infor mation system or the infor mation that the
"system processes , stores , or transmits; or (2)"
constitutes a violation or imminent threat of  violation
"of  security policies , security procedures , or"
acce ptable use policies . ”  Under the proposed Incident
"Notification R equirements , a banking"
org anization recei ving notifications of  “computer -security
incidents” from a bank ser vice pro vider
"2m ust deter mine whether the incident rises to the lev el of  a “notification incident” and, if  it does ,"
m ust re por t the incident to the org anization ’ s primar y Banking R egulator .
1
A n umber of  elements mak e the definition of  “computer -security
incident” in the Incident
Notification R equirements extremely broad and could
result in frequent and v oluminous re por ting
"b y bank ser vice pro viders . Specifically , the Incident"
Notification R equirements:
●
Encompass not only those occur rences that ha v e any
"actual har m, but also any occur rences"
that ha v e the
potential
to cause har m to infor mation
or infor mation systems; and
●
Encompass
violations
as w ell as
imminent thr eat of
violations
of
"security policies , security pr ocedur es"
or
acce ptab le use policies
.
Google Cloud appreciates that this definition of  “computer -security
incident” needs to be read in
the context of  the additional languag e in the Incident
Notification R equirements specifying that the
banking ser vice pro vider need notify the customer
only of  any “computer -security incident that it
"believ es in g ood faith could disr upt, deg rade , or"
impair ser vices . . . for four or more hours . ”  W hile
the four -hour languag e ma y ha v e been included in an
effor t to add a materiality element to the r ule
"and, thus , constrain the scope of  notifications that"
"w ould need to be made , it is not clear that the"
languag e will in fact ha v e that effect.
"Impor tantly , the definition of  computer -security incident"
relates to occur rences that ha v e actual or
potential impacts on
data
","
systems
", or"
security policies
","
security pr ocedur es
", or"
acce ptab le use policies
.
"Ho w ev er ,"
"the four -hour languag e relates to disr uption, deg radation,"
or impair ment of
ser vices
.  T he mismatc h in
scope of  the tw o sets of  pro visions mak es it difficult
to understand whic h incidents w ould in fact
need to be notified to customers .
T he breadth of  the categ ories included in the definition
of  “computer security incident” and the lac k
of  an effecti v e materiality requirement will lik ely
result in an extensi v e v olume of  notifications being
"g enerated from bank ser vices pro viders to bank customers ,"
whic h could ha v e significant unintended
consequences .
Bank ser vice pro viders’ attention and resources w ould
be focused on pro viding notifications that
"often will not be material, considering the kinds"
of  “notification ev ents” that are ultimately of
"concer n to the Banking R egulators , rather than on"
deter mining impact and designing remediations .
"Moreo v er , bank customers will be put in the position"
of  ha ving to sor t through larg e v olumes of
notifications from (lik ely n umerous) bank ser vice
pro viders to mak e deter minations of  whether they

"3rise to the lev el of  a “notification incident, ” resulting in increasing compliance burdens on the bank"
ser vice pro viders and a g ro wing prospect that tr ue
notification incidents will be lost in the ha ystac k.
T o a v oid these kinds of  unintended consequences and
to better tailor the Incident Notification
"R equirements to address the concer ns identified, Google"
Cloud urg es the Banking R egulators to
consider a few modifications:
●
Include only occur rences that result in actual har m
.
Occur rences that only ha v e the
potential to cause har m should be ex cluded from the scope of  notifications required from
"the bank ser vice pro viders , although the pro viders"
should contin ue to monitor these ev ents .
T he fact that an ev ent has not resulted in actual
data/systems compromise is evidence that
the bank ser vice pro viders’ controls are operating
as intended and that escalation to the
Banking R egulators is unnecessar y .  Making these occur rences
re por table w ould significantly
"increase the operational burden on all in v olv ed par ties ,"
including banking customers (who
w ould be recei ving ex cessi v e v olumes of  non-actionable
"infor mation), without a clear"
benefit.
Nonetheless . financial institutions and their pro viders
should contin ue infor mation sharing
"and ex c hanging best practices , including with respect"
to unsuccessful incidents as w ell as
ag g reg ated post-mor tems on addressed attac ks .  T he
Banking R egulators should facilitate
suc h ex c hang e through relev ant v oluntar y fora.
●
Eliminate the se parate re por ting categ or y for security
"policies , security procedures , and"
acce ptable use policies
:  It is difficult to concei v e
of  a “violation or imminent threat of
"violation of  security policies , security procedures ,"
or acce ptable use policies” ha ving the kind
of  material impacts that could result in a “notification
ev ent” unless they first ha v e some
impact on customer data or on infor mation systems .
T his is par ticularly tr ue of  “acce ptable
use policies” that often include requirements entirely
unrelated to security .  Including
"“security policies , security procedures , or acce ptable"
use policies” as an additional re por ting
categ or y expands the scope of  re por table “computer -security
"incidents , ” and hence the"
"v olume of  notifications , without clear benefit.  T he"
requirement to re por t occur rences that
result in har m to data/systems should capture all
material incidents .
●
Establish Materiality R equirements Specific to Eac h
T ype of  R e por table Occur rence
:  T he
pro vision clarifying that the banking ser vice pro vider
need notify the customer only of  any
“computer -security incident that it believ es in g ood
"faith could disr upt, deg rade , or impair"
ser vices . . . for four or more hours” is helpful
in establishing a “materiality” boundar y for
"some cases -- specifically , those in whic h the primar y"
impact of  an occur rence is on the
a v ailability
of  infor mation or an infor mation system.
In the case of  occur rences that impact
the confidentiality or integ rity of  infor mation or
"the infor mation system, ho w ev er , the four"
hour pro vision ma y not ser v e as an effecti v e measure
"of  materiality .  Consider , for example , a"
h ypothetical breac h that results in significant data
exfiltration but not in any cognizable
impact on the a v ailability of  the ser vice being pro vided.
4Google Cloud urg es the Banking R egulators to consider dev eloping alter nati v e materiality
criteria for these situations .  T hese criteria should tak e into account the different types of
"bank ser vice pro viders and, cr ucially , what infor mation"
will and will not be a v ailable to them
"when making the assessment.  F or example , for pri v acy"
"reasons , a cloud ser vice pro vider"
supplying infrastr ucture-as-a-ser vice to a banking
org anization ma y ha v e little visibility into
the impact that an incident will ha v e on the banking
"org anization.  In that situation, shaping"
the materiality criteria in ter ms of  the impact on
the banking org anization w ould be
"ineffecti v e and, ag ain, lik ely to lead to o v er -re por ting ."
"Rather , to the g reatest extent possible ,"
materiality should be based on agnostic criteria that
can be applied ev en b y third par ties in
"suc h a situation -- for example , en umerating the specific"
kinds of  har ms that are
"encompassed b y the pro vision (e .g ., “accidental or"
"unla wful destr uction, loss , alteration,"
"unauthorized disclosure of , or access to , data”)."
W e believ e these modifications could help ac hiev e
a better balance betw een the scope of  re por ting
"(and, in par ticular , the critical shared interest"
in a v oiding o v er -re por ting) and ensuring that critical
and material incident infor mation is g etting to banking
org anizations and to regulators .
2.
How should the 36-hour timeframe for notifica tion
"be modified, if  at all, and w hy?"
Should it be made shor ter or long er? Should it star t
at a dif ferent time? Should the
timeframe be modified for cer tain types of  notifica tion
incidents or banking
"organiza tions (for e xample , should banks with total"
assets of  less than $10 billion
have a dif ferent timeframe)?
Although the 36-hour timeframe applies to notifications
b y banking org anizations of  “notification
"incidents” to their primar y Banking R egulator , not"
notifications of  “computer security incidents” b y
"bank ser vice pro viders to their bank customers , Google"
Cloud appreciates the recognition b y the
Banking R egulators that a banking org anization is
unlik ely to “be able to deter mine that a
notification incident has occur red immediately upon
becoming a w are of  a computer security
incident. ”  T he Banking R egulators note that “a banking
org anization w ould tak e a reasonable
amount of  time to deter mine that it has experienced
a notification incident” and that “only once the
banking org anization has made suc h a deter mination
w ould the requirement to re por t within 36
hours begin. ”
Ensuring that the Notification R equirements allo w
an oppor tunity for reasonable in v estig ation is
impor tant to helping ensure that material incidents
are f lag g ed to the regulators and are not
obfuscated b y an inf lux of  false positi v es or non-material
matters .  Google Cloud urg es the Banking
R egulators to also apply the same rationale to the
notification requirements that apply to the
notification of  “computer -security incidents” b y bank
ser vice pro viders to their banking customers
and to ensure that sufficient time for in v estig ation
is built into that requirement.

response to
Questions 3 and 6 belo w .
3.
Is the pr oposed requirement tha t banking or ganiza tions
and bank ser vice pr ovider s
notify the appr opria te par ty when they ‘‘believe in
good faith’’ tha t they are
experiencing or have e xperienced a notifica tion incident
"or computer-security incident,"
"as applicable , sufficientl y clear such tha t banking"
organiza tions and bank ser vice
5provider s under stand w hen they should pr ovide notice? Ho w should the ‘‘believes in
"good faith’’ standard be modified, if  at all? F or"
"example , should the standard be"
‘‘reasonabl y believes’’ for either banking or ganiza tions
or bank ser vice pr ovider s?
T he proposed Incident Notification R equirements specify
that a bank ser vice pro vider notify an
affected banking org anization customer “immediately
after the bank ser vice pro vider experiences a
computer -security incident that it believ es in g ood
"faith could disr upt, deg rade , or impair ser vices"
pro vided . . . for four or more hours . ”  Google Cloud
suppor ts the use of  the ter m “believ es in g ood
faith” to modify the notification requirement in this
context.
One of  the v er y first ste ps in Google Cloud’ s incident
"response is conducting, as quic kly as possibly ,"
a triag e assessment of  the incident and assessing
its sev erity (whic h ma y be adjusted as more
infor mation is kno wn).  Google Cloud’ s customer notifications
are tied to its best effor ts
assessments of  these issues based on the infor mation
a v ailable to it.  T he nature of  the “g ood faith”
"standard is suc h that it recognizes that, often, the"
infor mation upon whic h assessments are made is
c hanging and incomplete (especially at early stag es
of  incident response) and that an assessment of
sufficiency needs to tak e this context into account.
"By contrast, a “reasonably believ es” standard could"
introduce too m uc h uncer tainty and in vite
"second-guessing of  decisions that are , b y necessity ,"
made quic kly and potentially without k ey facts
"that are only kno wn later , incenti vizing proph ylactic"
o v er -re por ting that will not benefit bank ser vice
"pro viders , their banking org anization customers , or"
the Banking R egulators .
"As discussed belo w in response to Question 6, ho w ev er ,"
"the str ucture of  the sentence , and in"
par ticular the phrase “immediately after the bank
ser vice pro vider experiences a computer -security
incident” introduce uncer tainty as to the exact timeframe
that is applicable to the notification
pro vided b y the bank ser vice pro vider .  F or the reasons
"discussed in that response , Google Cloud"
urg es the Banking R egulators to consider using languag e
other than “immediately after . ”  Google
"Cloud urg es the Banking R egulators to consider using,"
"instead, languag e that is more in line with the"
notion that bank ser vice pro viders need to be able
to mak e a g ood faith assessment of  impact
"follo wing an occur rence and that, in many cases , the"
infor mation ma y not be a v ailable to mak e suc h
an assessment “immediately” after an occur rence .
4.
Do existing contracts betw een banking or ganiza tions
and bank ser vice pr ovider s
alread y have pr ovisions tha t would allo w banking or ganiza tions
to meet the pr oposed
notifica tion incident requirements?
T he proposed notification incident requirements do
"not align entirely with existing approac hes , in"
par ticular when it comes to ev ents impacting confidentiality/integ rity
(as opposed to a v ailability).
T herefore pro visions in existing contracts are unlik ely
to fully address the proposed requirements .
F or instance:
6●
"for the reasons noted in the response to Question 1 abo v e , in our experience pro viders do"
"not in practice notify customers of  potential har m,"
violations of  security policies etc that do
not result in any har m or violations of  security policies
"etc .  In par ticular , gi v en the usual"
"content of  acce ptable use policies , it is not typical"
to notify a customer of  an acce ptable use
policy violation b y another customer absent any har m
to the customer being notified.
●
for the reasons noted in the response to Question
"6 belo w , in our experience pro viders are"
typically not able to notify customers immediately
after an ev ent that impacts the
confidentiality/integ rity of  infor mation of  infor mation
"systems .  T ypically , pro viders will"
commit to doing this promptly or without undue dela y
after an incident has been
in v estig ated and declared.
"Although contracts v ar y , our experience is that pro viders"
"do , ho w ev er , pro vide notification of  ev ents"
that actually impact the a v ailability of  infor mation
"and infor mation systems .  Ag ain, although this is"
"done promptly , it is usually not possible to do so"
“immediately” gi v en the need for reasonable
in v estig ation (as recognized b y the Banking R egulators
in connection with the “notification
incident” timelines --
see
Question 2 abo v e).
"Finally , our experience is that m ulti-tenant contexts ,"
"lik e public cloud ser vices contracts , typically"
utilize one-to-many tools suc h as dashboards to comm unicate
ser vice a v ailability ev ents and scalable
1:1 tools suc h as emails/suppor t tic k ets to comm unicate
ev ents impacting customer data.
5.
Should the pr oposed r ule for bank ser vice pr ovider s
require bank ser vice pr ovider s to
notify all banking or ganiza tion customer s or onl y
those af fected b y a computer-security
incident under the pr oposed r ule?
Google Cloud urg es the Banking R egulators to limit
the scope of  the notification requirement to
banking org anization customers affected b y a computer -security
incident.  Expansion to include all
banking org anization customers could (1) g enerate
significant confusion about the scope and impact
"of  an incident, potentially consuming bank org anization"
resources unnecessarily; (2) dra w bank
ser vice pro vider resources a w a y from critical incident
"identification, coordination, and resolution"
acti vities; and (3) result in significantly more noise/false
positi v es being re por ted to banking
regulators .
If  the intent behind notifying a broader g roup w ere
"to facilitate infor mation sharing, there ma y be"
better w a ys to do so that w ould not ha v e the neg ati v e
"impacts described abo v e .  F or example , the"
"broader g roup of  financial institutions , pro viders"
and Banking R egulators could contin ue
infor mation sharing and ex c hanging best practices
through relev ant v oluntar y fora.
6.
Within w hat timeframe should bank ser vice pr ovider s
provide notifica tion to banking
organiza tions? Is immedia te notifica tion after e xperiencing
a disr uption in ser vices
provided to af fected banking or ganiza tion customer s
and to re port to those
"organiza tions reasonable? If  not, w hat is the appr opria te"
amount of  time for a bank
service pr ovider to deter mine it has e xperienced a
material disr uption in ser vice tha t
"impacts its banking or ganiza tion customer s, and w hy?"
"7Under the proposed Incident Notification R equirements ,"
a bank ser vice pro vider m ust notify eac h
affected banking org anization customer “immediately
after the bank ser vice pro vider experiences a
computer security incident that it believ es in g ood
"faith could disr upt, deg rade , or impair ser vices"
. . .
for four or more hours . ”
T he ter m “immediately after” sug g ests that no time
could ha v e elapsed betw een when a
computer -security incident occur red and when notification
"has to happen.  Ho w ev er , as discussed in"
"response to Question 3 abo v e , there is almost alw a ys"
some period of  time in whic h facts need to be
g athered in order to mak e an infor med assessment (ev en
"if  preliminar y) as to nature , scope , and"
impact of  an incident.  Making a deter mination “in
g ood faith” that a computer -security incident
"“could disr upt, deg rade , or impair ser vices pro vided"
. . . for four or more hours” (or ex ceeds some
other materiality threshold) ma y not be possible “immediately
after” the bank ser vice experiences a
computer -security ev ent. ”
"As suc h, the use of  the ter m “immediate” creates confusion"
as to the point in time at whic h a bank
ser vice pro vider needs to pro vide notice .  It is notable
"in this reg ard, that both this question (about"
the effect of  the “immediately after” languag e) and
Question 3 abo v e (about the effect of  the “g ood
faith” languag e) both relate to the timeframes that
apply to the bank ser vice pro vider .  T he tw o
phrases ha v e different time connotations and it is
unclear whic h is controlling .
"T o clarify the applicable timeframe , Google Cloud"
urg es the Banking R egulators to consider
alter nati v e languag e that con v eys that notification
should occur “promptly” and “without undue
dela y” once a g ood faith deter mination is made as
to materiality (whether the four hour standard or
some other).  T his should con v ey the sense of  urg ency
without sug g esting that bank ser vice
pro viders submit notifications without any attempt
to collect the kind of  infor mation that will help
deter mine whether the computer -security incident is
one that is material.
"Impor tantly , as discussed in response to Question"
"2, the Banking R egulators recognize the"
impor tance of  allo wing time for reasonable in v estig ation
in the context of  notifications b y banking
org anizations of  “notification incidents” to their
"primar y Banking R egulator .  Specifically , the"
Banking R egulators ac kno wledg e that a banking org anization
is unlik ely to “be able to deter mine
that a notification incident has occur red immediately
upon becoming a w are of  a computer security
incident. ”  T he Banking R egulators note that “a banking
org anization w ould tak e a reasonable
amount of  time to deter mine that it has experienced
a notification incident” and that “only once the
banking org anization has made suc h a deter mination
w ould the requirement to re por t within 36
hours begin. ”  Google Cloud urg es the Banking R egulators
to apply the same rationale to the
notification requirements that apply to the notification
of  “computer -security incidents . ”
7.
The ag encies under stand tha t man y existing contracts
between banking or ganiza tions
and bank ser vice pr ovider s contain notifica tion pr ovisions
regarding ma terial incidents
"8and tha t, generall y, bank ser vice pr ovider s use automa ted systems to notify banking"
organiza tions of  service disr uptions . The ag encies
are seeking infor mation on ho w
bank ser vice pr ovider s currently notify banking or ganiza tions
of service disr uptions
under e xisting contracts betw een bank ser vice pr ovider s
and banking or ganiza tions .
Do those contracts contempla te the pr ovision of  notice
to at least two indi viduals a t an
affected banking or ganiza tion? Is the method of  notice
specified in e xisting contracts
"(for e xample , email, tele phone , etc.) suf ficient to"
allow bank ser vice pr ovider s to
provide notice of  computer security incidents to a t
least two indi viduals a t affected
"banking or ganiza tions? If  not, ho w best could the"
requirement for bank ser vice
provider s to notify a t least two indi viduals a t affected
banking or ganiza tions be
achieved most ef ficientl y and cost ef fectively for
both par ties?
Google Cloud notifies customers of  data incidents
b y deli v ering notification(s) to customers
electronically .  Ser vice disr uptions are notified
on a public dashboard (customer can enable RSS feed

Describe cir cumstances in w hich a bank ser vice pr ovider
would become a ware of  a
material disr uption tha t could be a notifica tion incident
for banking or ganiza tion
customer s but the banking or ganiza tion customer s would
not be a ware of  the incident.
Would it be over ly burdensome to cer tain bank ser vice
"provider s, such as smaller bank"
"service pr ovider s, to pr ovide notice of  material disr uptions ,"
"degrada tions , or"
impair ments to their af fected banking or ganiza tion
"customer s and, if  so, why?"
Banking org anization customers are lik ely to become
a w are of  a material disr uption that has an
impact on a v ailability of  data/systems early on in
"an incident, potentially at the same time as a bank"
"ser vice pro vider .  Ho w ev er , this ma y not be tr ue of"
a material disr uption that has an impact
primarily on confidentiality or integ rity of  data.
9III. Conclusion
Google Cloud appreciates the oppor tunity to pro vide feedbac k on the proposed Incident
Notification R equirements .  W e look forw ard to contin uing to w ork with the Banking R egulators as
the proposal is finalized and implemented.
