RE: Fiserv Comment on  RIN 3064 -AF59 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Computer -Security Incident 
Notification Requirements for Banking Organizations and Their Bank Service Providers  
 
Mr. Sheesley:  
 
"Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ: FISV), appreciates the opportunity to comment on the joint Federal Reser ve "
"System (Fed), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and Office of the Comptroller of the "
"Currency (OCC)  (collectively, the  “joint regulators ”) Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) related to "
bank service provider and banking organization outage i ncident notification requirements.  
 
Fiserv  understands the intent driving this proposed regulation  is to make banks and their prudential 
regulators more aware of outages that threaten the security of a system or that makes the system 
"otherwise un available . Additionally , we  agree that timely notification is an  important component  of "
"safety and soundness , and we support the practice of having bank service providers provide transparent "
and consistent notification to their bank customers when systems are unavailable  or compromised.  In 
"this spirit, we a ppreciate  the opportunity to provide our feedback to the joint regulators as you work to "
further develop and finalize this rule.  
 
"Ultimately, while we support the intent of the proposed regulation , we believe  that  some adjustments "
should be considered to ensure that  the rules and requirements include clear and understood 
"definitions , and afford market participants the necessary disclosure protections given the potentially "
"sensitive nature of these notification disclosures. Further, we believe that an effective framework for "
"outage incident notifications should complement current regula tory practice s, should provide clear "
"guardrails against irrelevant or unimportant notifications to banking organizations, and provide "
guidance to all banking system participants in a manner that supports the mission of the joint 
"regulators.  A notification structure that inundates banking organizations, service providers, and the joint "
regulators with non -essential notifications will make it more challenging to identify and respond to 
significant threats to the banking system.  
 
"To achieve th ese outcome s, we offer four technical suggestion s that in our view , if adopted, will align "
"with  the joint regulators ’ efforts to craft rules that balance transparency, information sharing, and early "
indicators of market disruptions with the potential  for notification  fatig ue or desensitization .  
 
About Fiserv  
"Fiserv  is a global leader in financial services enabling technology and payment processing , and w e "
"interact daily  with financial institutions of all asset sizes, businesses, and individual consumers. We are  a "
"leading  account process or, commonly referred to as a  “core” provider, delivering digital  solutions to 2 | P a g e  "
" financial institutions in the United States , as well as a provider of many other  services to financial "
"institutions , including card processing, bill payments, network services, and security and fraud "
protection . 
 
Fiserv Perspective  
Fiserv supports  the desire of the joint regulators to have greater transparency in to the health of banking 
organizations ’ digital  systems and processes  and early warn ing of incidents that pose threat s to the 
"confidence and stability of the banking system . Based on the background included within the NPR, we "
"recognize that th is proposal i s not aimed solely at security incidents, but rather at any outage that could "
materially disrupt a banking organization’s operations  and thereby  threaten the confidence in the 
banking system.  
 
Fiserv  is focused on providing  clarity and transparency to its banking clients about outages that interrupt 
or degrade systems  managed by Fiserv  for our banking organization s. These technical comment s provide 
"perspective on how Fiserv interprets the NPR and , with adjustment , how we believe the NPR can be  "
strengthen ed. 
 
"As the joint regulators further contemplate the need for a final rule, Fiserv  recommend s considering the "
following :  
1. provid e an express exemption from the bank service provider ’s notification standard  for 
scheduled or pla nned maintenance windows ; 
2. modify the title and definition of Computer Security Incident  to distinguish between system 
outages and cyber  security outages ; 
3. modify the bank service provider’s notification standard to reduce the  potential for over -
notification ; and  
4. redefin e Affected Banking Organizations to include only Impacted Banking Organizations 
and eliminat e the expan sion of  the notification standard  for bank servic e providers beyond 
the joint regulators ’ intended audience.  
 
1. Exempt Scheduled Maintenance Windows from Notification Requirement  
 
"As written, the NPR’s definition of Computer Security Incident could include scheduled and planned "
"maintenance outages that are essential to the integrity and security of digital systems, processes, and "
programs.  Fiserv establishes maintenance windows to perform necessary work on the programs and 
systems we manage for our banking customers and proactively communicate s the cadence and schedule 
"of those  maintenance  windows . As such, we’re concerned that the omission of this exemption could "
lead to redundant notifications.   
 
"Generally, bank service providers will schedule maintenance for a regular cadence during off -peak "
"hours , such as  on a Sunday from 12 :00 AM ET to 5:00 AM  ET. Leading up to this pre-planned "
"maintenance , the bank service provider may also communicate  with the bank customer whether  it "
"intends  to use this window . Within this notification, the bank service provid er typically  includes an "
estimated timeframe within the window of an outage and the reason for the maintenance.  
 
If the definition of  Computer Security Incident  does not exclude scheduled or planned maintenance 
"outages , a bank service provider would not only provide advanced notice of the upcoming window  (and "
"associated communications) , but at the start of the planned outage ( in the example above 12:00  AM "
"ET), it would  also be required to notify two individuals  at the bank  of an outage that may last 4  or more 3 | P a g e  "
" hours , pursuant to the NPR’s proposed standards . This second communication could potentially "
generate an unnecessary and redundant notification . Fiserv does not believe it is the intent of this NPR 
for the bank service provider to provide an outag e notification for this type of outage . 
 
"This exemption, however, should not extend beyond the timeframe provided to the bank in the pre-"
"planned scheduled maintenance window. For example, if, in the above example, the bank service "
"provider ’s maintenance extends  past 5:00  AM ET, the outage could  result in a notifiable incident under "
"the NPR , should the outage  have the potential to extend 4 or more hours  beyond the planned "
maintenance window .   
 
2. Modify  the Computer Security Incident Definition  
 
"As previously stated,  Fiserv  acknowledges the desire of the joint regulators to provide banking "
"organizations with increased information about all system outages, not just those deriving from cyber "
security events. This is a standard that Fiserv currently  employs and agrees it is an important standard to 
promote industry wide . The technical corrections that we  propose to this definition are intended  to 
provide greater uniformity and clarity to the industry about what constitutes an incident and what 
constitutes a reportable  incident.  
 
"As written, Fiserv believes the title and definition of Computer Security Incident  allude s to the joint "
"regulators ’ interest and focus  on cyber events, such as hacking, malware, or denial of service. As a "
"result, Fiserv  proposes  that the title and definition should be amended to provide uniformity  and clarity  "
and align  on the scope of the proposal . 
 
"First , Fiserv recomm ends that the title be renamed  to Outage Notification Incident . This retitle, or a "
"similar  title, increases clarity for bank service providers and banking organizations that  the proposal "
expands beyond  cyber  security events.  
 
"Second , Fiserv believes the NPR would be improved by creating two distinct types  of outages  identified "
within  an Outage Notification Incid ent. These two forms of outages could be  defined as a (1) System 
"Outage, or those incidents focused on server interruptions,  software issues, natural disaster s, or other "
"non-cyber security related events; and  (2) Computer Security Outage,  or those focused on cyber "
incursions and disruptions . 
 
"Moreover, we ask the joint regulators to consider defining Computer Security Outage  in a way that "
conforms the language to the definition of  “cybersecurity incident” in the following existing federal 
standard :  
 
• National I nstitute of Standards and Technology (NIST) “Framework for Improving Critical 
Infrastructure Cybersecurity Version 1.1”  –   
"o Cybersecurity  – The process of protecting information by preventing, detecting, and "
responding to attacks.  
o Cybersecurity Event – A cybersecurity change that may have an impact on 
"organizational operations (including mission, capabilities, or reputation).  "
o Cybersecurity incident – A cybersecurity event that has been determined to have an 
impact on the organization prompting the need for response and recovery . 
 4 | P a g e  
" Taken together, Fiserv envisions the definition set to read : "
 “Outage Notification Incident” means an occurrence that  results in  a 
(1) “System Outage”  – the unavailability of an information system or the information  
"the system processes, stores, or transmits; or  "
"(2) “Computer Security Outage” – a cybersecurity incident , defined in the National "
Institute of Standards and Technology “Framework for Improving Critical 
Infrastructure Cybersecurity Version 1.1 .” 
 
3. Modify Bank Service Provider Notification Standard  
 
Fiserv is concerned that  the NPR includes duplicative and potentially overly b road language  that could 
result in the unintended expansion of notification s made by bank service providers. The inclusion of 
"both potential harm within the Computer Security Incident definition and disrupt, degrade, or impair  "
within the notification stand ard for bank service providers  could lead bank service providers to create  
disparate notifications standards .  
 
"Focusing solely on computer security , coupling a notification requirement triggered by potential harm to "
"the confidentiality, integrity or availability of an information system and a good faith belief it could  "
"disrupt, degrade, or impair  service for four or more hours , means that identified, interrupted , and "
mitigated  cyber incursion attempts could still r esult in a bank service provider  notify ing banking 
organizations  out of  an abundance of caution . We believe  this may be  an unintended expansion of the 
purpose and scope of the NPR.   
 
"Moreover, with both terms included  in the NPR , a denial of service attempt against a bank service "
"provider, which is identified and mitigated against – but that results in only slight degradations to a "
"system managed by  a bank service provider , could trigger a notification . In this example , despite t he fact "
"that  the event was  identified,  mitigated, and was ultimately  not a threat to the stability of the bank "
"service provider, banking organization or the financial system – the potential such event  could slightly "
degrade services for 4 or more hours wou ld deem it to be a notifiable incident under the NPR.   
 
We understand that the  proposal is intended to promote the safety and soundness of banking 
organizations  by providing an “early alert” of serious threats to the banking system . Successfully 
"identifie d and mitigated cyber security events do not pose a threat to the safety, soundness, or "
confidence in a bank or the broader financial ecosystem  – and no regulatory alert should be needed in 
these controlled situations .  
 
"As a result, Fiserv recommends that  the bank service provider reporting standard be modified  to state:   "
 
" A bank service provider, after confirming it is experiencing a [outage notification incident], which "
"it believes in good faith will last more than 4 hours, shall notify  the designated 2 individuals at  "
the directly impacted banking organizations  of the [outage notification incident ].  
 
4.  Affected Bankin g Organization  Not Defined  – Implication on Bank Service Providers  
 
Fiserv believes the aim of the NPR and any subsequent  rule issue d by the joint regulators regarding 
notification requirements is to create a uniform standard that prevents bank service providers or 
banking organizations from being required to interpret and establish unique and disparate standards 
"and policies . We are concerned, however, that t he NPR ’s broad and undefined use of affected banking 5 | P a g e  "
 organization  within the bank service provider notification standards fails to achieve this goal. Fise rv 
"recommends, as highlighted in the update d notification standard above , that only banking organizations "
directly impacted by an outage should be notified .  
 
"As written  in the NPR , affected banking  organizations  could be interprete d several  ways.  Without "
"clarification , it is possible that bank service providers  will feel compelled to notify banking organizations "
"of all potential incident s not based on the observance of an actual  outage or incident, but based on the "
location of the banking organization’s se rvices within the infrastructure of the bank service provider.  
 
"For example, a bank service provider that supports 20 banking organizations on the same  multi -tenant  "
platform  is informed of a service degradation by a banking organization . Under the proposed 
"notification structure, it is possible that the bank service provider, before knowing the severity, extent, "
"scope, or cause of the degradation , could decide that it is oblig ated to notify  all 20 banking organizations "
"on the  multi -tenant  platform , to find out upon further review that only one banking organization  should "
have been notified based on actual service degradation .  
 
"As a result, as drafted , the NPR  could compel bank  service providers  to “over notify” banking "
"organizations, resulting in the  unintended consequence of notification  fatigue and d ilution in the quality "
and importance of notifications  related to the actual safety and stability of the banking  system. Fiserv 
recommends amending the NPR to remove  the term  affected banking organizations and include the 
clear obligation to notify impacted banking organizations .  
 
Conclusion  
As the joint regulators further examine the need for a final rule providing outage notification 
"requirements, we believe that our  role as a bank service provider positions us well  to assist  in this effort, "
and we are  willing to provide further technical co mment and suggestions as needed. We respectfully 
"request review of the  four technical amendments express ed in this comment, as we believe that  "
incorporation of them will enable consistent and uniform notification standards across the financial 
system  and a final rule t hat achieve s the goals laid out in the NPR .  
 
"Once again, Fiserv appreciates the joint regulators ’ willing ness  to accept comment s on this NPR , and we "
"welcome continued engagement, should the joint regulators find further dialogue useful.  "
 
"Sincerely,  "
