"Greetings,  "
 
The following comments are submitted on behalf of the Independent 
"Bankers Association of Texas (“IBAT”), a trade association representing "
"more than 350 independent, community banks domiciled in Texas.   "
 
"1. How should the definition of ‘‘computer -security incident’’ be modified, if "
"at all? For example, should it include only occurrences that result in actual "
"harm to the confidentiality, integ rity, or availability of an information system "
"or the information the system processes, stores, or transmits? Should it "
include only occurrences that constitute an actual violation of security 
"policies, security procedures, or acceptable use policies?  "
"Generally speaking, this is the definition adopted by the National Institute "
of Standards and Technology (NIST) and should be adopted for the sake of 
"uniformity. While broad enough for banks, the agencies should clarify that "
this definition includes incidents  occurring at third -party information 
systems and their sub-contractors (fourth -party providers) that collect 
banking related information.  
"2. How should the definition of ‘‘notification incident’’ be modified, if at all?  For example, instead of ‘‘computer security incident,’’ should the definition of ‘‘notification incident’’ refer "
"to other NIST terms and definitions, or another recognized source of terms and definitions? Should the "
"standard for materially disrupt, degrade , or impair be altered to reduce potential redundancy between the "
terms or to consider different types of impact on the banking organization? Should the definition not 
include language that is consistent with the ‘‘core business line’’ and ‘‘critical opera tion’’ definitions 
included in the resolution -planning rule? Should those elements of the definition only apply to banking 
organizations that have resolution planning requirements?  
The term ‘notification incident’ should be crafted to include incidents oc curring at third -party service 
provider information systems and the sub -contractors (fourth -party providers) of those third -party service 
providers that collect banking related information. Sub -contractors of third -party service providers with 
access to th e information or systems that contain covered information of banking organization customers 
should be held to the same standard as third -party service providers that contract directly with the 
banking organizations.  
"3. How should the 36-hour  timeframe for  notification be modified, if at all, and why? Should it be made "
shorter or longer? Should it start at a different time? Should the timeframe be modified for certain types 
"of notification incidents or banking organizations (for example, should banks with t otal assets of less than "
$10 billion have a different timeframe)?  
The proposed rule would require such notification upon the occurrence of a notification incident as soon 
as possible and no later than 36 -hours after the banking organization  customer  belie ves in good faith that 
the incident occurred. That should be revised to not exceed 48 -hours after the banking organization 
customer believes in good faith that the incident occurred. Community banks in particular need the 
additional 12 hours to evaluate th e situation and implement an appropriate incident response plan.   
9. Do existing contracts between banking organizations and bank service providers already have provisions 
that would allow banking organizations to meet the proposed notification incident r equirements?  
"No doubt most will, but some will not. The proposed rule should clarify specific contract expectations for "
both bank service providers and bank organizations. Contract expectations should include sub -contractors 
of bank service providers as w ell.  
11. Should the proposed rule for bank service providers require bank service providers to notify all banking 
organization customers or only those affected by a computer -security incident under the proposed rule?  
Bank service providers should only notify those customers affected by the computer -service incident. To 
notify all banking organization customers will not doubt cause the banking organization customers and 
the bank service provider to respond to questions and concerns from banking organization customers not 
affected by the computer -security incident. When a ‘computer -security incident’ under the proposed rule 
"has occurred, time is a valuable resource and  to have to expend it on banking organization customers not "
impacte d will tax that valuable resource without providing any benefit to banking organization customers 
not impacted.  
12. Within what timeframe should bank service providers provide notification  to banking organizations? Is 
immediate notification after experiencing a disruption in services provided to affected banking 
"organization customers and to report to those organizations reasonable? If not, what is the appropriate "
amount of time for a bank service provider to determine it has experienced a material disruption in service 
"that impacts its banking organization customers, and why?  Unlike a ‘computer -security incident’ which requires time to identify and evaluate, a disruption in service "
is inst antaneously apparent and bank service providers can immediately notify banking organizations of 
the disruption in service. Customers of those banking organization customers will no doubt contact their 
"bank when the disruption of service is noticed and not the bank service provider, so immediate "
notification to the banking organization customers is appropriate  to handle bank customer concerns in a 
timely and thorough manner.  
Texas community bankers are dedicated to ensuring customer information is protected  when shared with 
"bank service providers. Any proposed rule, if carefully crafted, could be the cornerstone for ensuring that "
bank organizations and bank service providers have a clear and reasonable standard for the notification 
of primary regulators .  
 
Thank you for this opportunity comment.  
 
"Sincerely,  "
"Christopher L. Williston, CAE  "
President and CEO
