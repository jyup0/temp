To whom it may concern :  
 
"On behalf of the Electronic Transactions Association (“ETA”), we appreciate the opportunity to "
"share our thoughts on the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of "
"the Federal Reserve System, and the Fede ral Deposit Insurance Corporation ( “Agencies ”) "
noticed of proposed rulemaking relating to computer -security incident notification requirements 
for banking organizations and their bank service providers.   
 
ETA members support  the Agencies’ goal of ensuring timely awareness of significant 
cybersecurity threats in order to promote the safety and soundness of the  financial system.  In that 
"regard, we appreciate the Agencies’ effort to reduce additional burden to maximize the bank "
service providers  and financial institution’s ability to protect consumers and restore the 
"confidence in the systems that the ecosystem relies on. However, there are a number of concerns "
and these  recommendations are intended to bring additional clarity and  consistency to the 
"proposed incident reporting framework, to ensure the Agencies receive timely notification of the "
"significant cybersecurity incidents that are the focus of the proposed rule, and to minimize excess "
"burden on bank service  providers and financial institutions , including by avoiding unnecessary "
and burdensome over -reporting of less significant or easily remediated matters not intended to be 
captured by the proposed rule.

Comments  
 
36-Hour Timeframe for Notification  
 
ETA members  appreciate t he importance of early detection of significant cybersecurity incidents 
and support the goal of ensuring early detection of emerging threats to individual banking 
organizations and the broader financial system. We also appreciate the Agencies’ 
"acknowledgme nt that, in requiring  bank service  providers and  financial institutions  to provide "
notification “as soon as possible and no later than 36 hours” after the y believe in good faith that a 
notification incident has occurred.  We believe a 36 -hour notification timeframe should be 
modified to require notification as soon as “practicable” and no later than 72 hours after a 
notification incident has occurred.  This would align the proposed rule with New York ’s 
Department of Financial Services  Cybersecurity Regulation  and allow the proper gathering of  
available information at a point in time to develop  and send communication.  
 
"In addition, to eliminate the burden of over -reporting that fall  below the reporting threshold after "
"appropriate review or investigation is performed, we believe it is critical that bank service  "
providers and financial institutions  understand  that they can conduct such review or 
"investigation, consistent with the proposed rule’s reporting requirements, before determining that "
a notification incident has occurred .  
 
Harmonizing Incident Definitions  
 
The proposed rule defines “computer -security incident” as “an occurrence that: ( i) results in 
"actual or potential harm to the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an information system "
"or the information that the system processes, stores, or transmits; or ( ii) constitutes a violation or "
"imminent threat of violation of security policies, security procedures, or acceptable use policies.” "
The proposed rule defines “notification incident” as “a computer -security incident that a banking 
"organization believes in good faith could materially disrupt , degrade, or impair:  (i) the ability of "
"the banking organization to carry out banking operations, activities, or processes, or deliver "
"banking products and services  to a material portion of its customer base, in the ordinary course "
"of business; (ii) any business line of a banking organization, including associated operations, "
"services, functions and support, and would result in a material loss of revenue, profit, or "
"franchise value; or (iii) those operations of a banking organization, including associated services, functions and support, as applicable, the failure or discontinuance of which would pose a threat "
to the financial stability of the United States.”    
 
We acknowledge and support the A gencies policy goals of minimizing compliance burden for 
bank service  providers and financial institutions and should use “notification incident ” as the 
primary incident reporting threshold.  
 
This would reduce the number of  high volume and less significan t or easily remediated 
occurrences  and incidents that do not result in actual harm should not give rise to a notification 
incident given the stated objectives of the proposed rule.   
 
"By adopting the “notification incident” definition, bank service  providers and financial "
"institutions would not have to report occurrences of no consequences that happen daily, such as "
phishing emails. The inclusion of these less significant occurrences would place unnecessary 
burden on bank service  providers and finan cial institutions and the unintended result would be 
over-reporting to the Agencies.  
 
Notifying the Agencies  
 
"We agree with the Agencies’ decision to allow notification through any technological means, but "
believe it is also critical to provide multiple potential channels of communication of notification 
"incidents. During a disruptive incident, some channels of communication may not be operational "
"or secure.  Additionally, a bank service  provider or financial institution may determine that it has "
"experienc ed a notification incident during a holiday, at the start of a weekend, or at other times "
during which any particular method may be less desirable or any designated agency representative 
may be unavailable. Permitting notification to any of several points of contact and through multiple 
channels would help ensure that the Agencies receive the notification timely .  
  
"We believe that simplicity of the notification is critical to the effectiveness of the  proposed  rule, "
"and that requiring any specific informati on or assessment would result in a complex, uncertain, "
"and burdensome process at a sensitive time.  Additionally, a ny requirements for information that "
need to be included in the notification should be standardized and clearly identified to help ensure 
"bank service  providers and financial institutions  are communicating the expected information, if "
"available, in order to minimize repeated follow -up questions from the Agencies.  "
 
"Given the critical need of being a  time sens itive manner, we recommend allowing “ significant "
service provider s” to directly alert the Agencies of an incident. The Agencies currently have 
statutory authority to supervise third -party servicers that enter into contractual arrangements with 
"their regula ted financial institutions.  With this explicit consent, it would  minimize  the burden these "
organizations  in post -notification communications while the notification incident is ongoing . We 
recommend that the final rule require bank service providers to notify their  banking organization 
"in a reasonable manner , after a relevant incident.  "
 
We also welcome further discussion about how the Agencies intend to share and secure any 
"information pro vided by a n organization in connection with a notification incident, an issue of "
"critical importance to our members.  For example , will or under what circumstances the  Agencies share the information with other authorities  and how the Agencies  would ensure the reporting data "
is safe and secure.
