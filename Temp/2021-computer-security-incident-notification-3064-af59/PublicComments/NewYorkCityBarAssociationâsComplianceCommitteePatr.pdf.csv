"  Re:  RIN 1557-AF02 (OCC), 7100-AF (Board) , 3064-AF59 (FDIC); Computer-Security "
Incident Notification Requirements for Banking Organizations and Their Bank 
Service Providers; Docket ID OCC-2020-0038 
 
The New York City Bar Association’s Compliance Committee (the “Compliance 
Committee”) submits this letter in  response to the request of the Office of the Comptroller of the 
"Currency, the Board of the Governors of the Fe deral Reserve System, and the Federal Deposit "
"Insurance Corporation (together , the “Agencies”) for comment about the Notice of Proposed "
"Rulemaking (the “Proposed Rule” or “Pr oposal”) published on Janua ry 12, 2021. The Proposal "
seeks to require a banking orga nization to provide its primary federal regulator with prompt 
notification of any signifi cant “computer-security incident” that  could jeopardize the viability of 
"its operations, which the Proposal refers to as a “notification incident.” The Compliance "
"Committee has a diverse membership that includes  attorneys from law firms, in-house counsel, "
"compliance professionals at various financial ins titutions, as well as representatives of regulatory "
and governmental agencies.   I. SUMMARY 
" At the outset, the Compliance Committee notes  that it supports the Agencies’ stated "
"objectives for the Proposed Rule, which include providing the Agencies with earlier awareness "
of cybersecurity incidents that  may so severely impact a banki ng organization that it can no 
"longer support its customers and could impact its safety and soundne ss, leading to its failure.  "
"The sooner the Agencies know of a cybersecurity ev ent, the better they can assess the extent of "
the threat and take appropriate action; provide information to a banking organization that may  
2 not have previously faced a par ticular type of notification inci dent; and conduct analyses across 
"supervised banking organizations to improve guidance, adjust s upervisory programs, and provide "
information to the industry to help banki ng organizations protect themselves.   
 
The Compliance Committee shares the Agencies ’ concern about the unique threats the 
"current cyber risk landscape poses for the bank ing industry, including th e increasing reliance by "
banking organizations on bank service providers to provide essential technology-related products 
and services. The Compliance Committee also recognizes that notification regimes currently required under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act a nd the Bank Secrecy Act do not provide the 
Agencies with information on cyber incidents affecting banking organi zation operations more 
broadly.  
 The Compliance Committee concurs that earl y notice to regulators is of critical 
importance. Regulators are the monitors of banking organization safety and soundness and 
should be informed of material security even ts and remedial effort s being undertaken. In 
"addition, the provision of prompt no tice is critical for regulators to monitor the banking sector "
and evaluate overall threats thereto. The SolarW inds attack demonstrat es the importance of 
notice – numerous interrelated private and public entities and their third parties were compromised by a nation state actor. The breadth of this attack demonstrates the need for 
regulators to be informed and help ensure best practices are bein g applied throughout the 
regulated community to  address the risks. 
 Most bank organizations have compliance pr ograms in place to address information 
"security, incident response, busin ess continuity, and vendor manage ment and to periodically test "
"these programs through risk a ssessments and tabletop exercise s. However, aspects of the "
"Proposed Rule, specifically  the definitions and mate riality of reportable s ecurity incidents, will "
"present an increased compliance burden for bank ing organizations, while providing the Agencies "
"with notice of far too many security incidents that, at 36 hours out, could, but may not ultimately, "
have a significant impact on operations. The Compliance Committee makes the following 
recommendations to limit the not ification requirement to high-th reshold cybersecurity incidents 
"that materially impact operations. As amended, the Proposed Rule will provide opportunity for "
bank organizations to continue to enhance their risk assessme nt practices and governance via a 
"reevaluation and updating of their incident re sponse, business continuity, and vendor risk "
"management programs, while providing the Agenci es with meaningful information to manage "
cyber threat risks that better  aligns with their stated obj ectives in the Proposed Rule. 
 
The Agencies seek comments on “all aspects of their proposal” and specifically on 16 
questions. This letter provides comments on the following issues covered by five questions: (i) 
"applicable definitions and standards triggering th e notice requirement (questions 1, 2, 4 and 15), "
and (ii) the form and met hod of notice (question 5). 
       
3 II. THE COMPLIANCE COMMI TTEE’S COMMENTS TO THE PROPOSED RULE  
 A. Proposed Definitions and Standards  
 
Questions 1 and 2 inquire how the definitions of “computer-security incident” and 
"“notification incident” should be modified, if at all. Question 4 asks whether the “believe in good "
faith” standard is sufficiently clear.  
The Proposed Rule would define a computer-security incident  as  
"an occurrence that (i) results in actual or potential harm  to the confidentiality, integrity "
"or availability of an information system or the information the syst em processes, stores, "
or transmits; or (ii) constitutes a violation or imminent threat of violation  of security 
"policies, security procedures , or acceptable use policies. "
Defining computer-security inci dent to include potential ha rm is a definition that is 
"common and appropriate for the sc ope of a cybersecurity program. Of course, it is critical to "
create a program to defend against potential threats and a good cybersecurity program will 
analyze threats that have been and that c ould be impactful on an organization. That would 
include both the threats that have been initiate d against a particular or ganization and those that 
"are being seen in the market at large. In addition, as proposed by the rule, it is appropriate for a "
bank service provider to be required to alert a banking institution to foreseeable threats and 
outages.
"1 However, as described below, the definiti on of computer-security incident for purposes "
of regulatory notice should be narrower.   
The Proposed Rule would define a notification incident  as  
a computer-security incident  that a banking organization believes in good faith  could  
"materially  disrupt, degrade or impair  - "
"the ability of the banking organization to carry out banki ng operations, activities, "
"or processes, or deliver banking products and services to a material portion of its "
"customer base, in the ordi nary course of business; "
"any business line of a banking organiza tion, including associated operations, "
"services, functions and support,  and would result in a ma terial loss of revenue, "
"profit, or franchise value; or "
"those operations of a banking organizati on, including asso ciated services, "
"functions and support, as applicable, the failure or discontinuance of which would pose a threat to the fi nancial stability of the U.S. "
 
1 This comment letter does not take a position regarding th e required notice bank service providers should provide to 
banking organizations either by rule or by contract. Such relationships can be critical to the financial infrastructure 
and are often factually distinct.  
4 As soon as possible and no later than 36 hour s after a banking orga nization believes in 
good faith that it has experienced a computer-securi ty incident that rises to the level of a 
"notification incident, the Proposal  would require the banking orga nization to notify its primary "
regulator. 
"In response, the Compliance Committee recommends that th e definition of computer-"
security incident for regulatory notice purposes be modified to be  limited to an occurrence that 
"results in actual harm  to applicable information and systems, or that results in actual violation  "
of applicable security policies. The Complian ce Committee also recommends that the definition 
of notification incident be modified to appl y to a computer-security  incident the banking 
"organization “believes in good faith has materially disrupted, de graded or impaired” its "
"operations, revenues or wider financial sector stability. Limiting regulatory notification to "
incidents that have materially ha rmed or violated the security of  an organization meets the stated 
"objectives of the Proposed Rule to provide the Ag encies with early alert of significant, high-"
threshold security incidents so that the Agenci es can assist the impacted organization to respond 
and recover as well as provide the Agencies with insight for ta king action to bolster the wider 
sector. 
"Unfortunately, cybersecurity threats against financial institutions are occurring with "
significant frequency. A fulsome cy bersecurity program must consta ntly be following threats and 
threat intelligence and analyzing potential thre ats against the organiza tion to improve systems 
and its defensive posture. Organizations routinely acquire threat intelligence information from a variety of sources for their cybe rsecurity programs and actual thre ats against the organization are 
"just a part of its threat intelligence analysis . However, analyzing threat intelligence for purposes "
of reporting it to regulators w ould add an unnecessary layer to th e evaluative process that could 
take time and energy away from protective operations and woul d result in notifications to 
"regulators beyond the intended pur pose of the Proposed Rule. Re porting to regulators actual, "
"rather than potential, events is a sensible requirement to enable the regulator to have visibility "
into events that may threaten the safety and s oundness of the institution. A regulator’s review of 
a banking organization’s overall eval uation and analysis of threats to the organization are better 
conducted in the context of an examination during which the regulator can observe the 
"organization’s threat evaluation pr ocess as a whole, rather than  a point in time threat.   "
The Compliance Committee supports tying the “believes in good faith” subjective 
"standard to an event that has actually occurr ed and materially impacted  operations, revenues or "
wider financial stability. It is appropriate to incl ude a materiality standard as there is no one-size-
fits-all assessment of the serious ness of a cybersecurity attac k. Different banking organizations 
have different capabilities and pr oducts and the likelihood of an  event endangering safety and 
soundness will differ for different institutions. Th at evaluation is best made by the banking 
organization and there is no regul atory benefit to s econd guessing an or ganization’s good faith 
judgment. The Compliance Committ ee supports the risk-based rather than one-size-fits-all 
approach. 
The Compliance Committee notes that th e Proposed Rule’s 36 hour notification 
requirement is substantially shorter than th e 72 hour notification requirements under the EU’s  
5 General Data Protection Regulat ion and the New York State Depa rtment of Fina ncial Services 
requirement under its cy bersecurity regulation.2 Given the compliance burdens posed in meeting 
"varied timeframe reporting requirements, the Agen cies should consider the universe of banking "
organizations that would be subj ect to these varied requirements in determining an appropriate 
and streamlined advance notification timeframe.  
Question 15 invites comment on specific exampl es of computer-security incidents that 
"should, or should not, constitute notification in cidents. The Committee reviewed the proposed "
non-exhaustive list of “notificati on incidents” under the revised definitions in its response to 
"Question 1 and 2, above, to determine if they ri se to the level of “actual harm,” “actual "
"violation,” or an incident that “has” occurred. Some proposed “notif ications incidents” as drafted "
"do not meet those standards. Specifically, th e use of subjective periods of time, e.g., "
"“undeterminable” and “extended period of time” outlined in in cidents 2 and 5, respectively, do "
not provide sufficient guidance on wh ether a notification incident wo uld rise to the level of an 
actual harm or violation of secu rity standards. The Compliance Committee appreciates the clarity 
"provided by incident 1 with respect to a defined time period, i.e., “more than 4 hours.” It is recommended that an objective timeframe be established for all incidents that include a time period element. Additionally, the Committee finds that incident 7 is captured by incident 2 "
and/or is duplicative of various fede ral and state breach notification laws.  
B.  Proposed Method of Notifying the Agencies 
 
Question 5 asks how banking organization notification should be provided to the 
"Agencies. According to the Proposed Rule, a ba nking organization only n eeds to share general "
information about what is known at the time and doe s not prescribe the contents to be included in 
"the notice nor any particular format – “any form of written or oral comm unication, via email or "
"phone, to a designated point of contact identi fied by the Agencies is sufficient.”  "
The Compliance Committee agrees that the cont ents of the notifica tion provided to the 
"Agencies not be prescribed; however, to  reduce the compliance burden for banking "
"organizations, the Compliance Committee urges th e Agencies to adopt an easy-to-follow, "
"streamlined, and secure form and method of notif ying the Agencies. Given th at the notification is "
meant to serve only as an early alert to regulato rs and is not intended to  provide any “assessment 
"of the incident,” the Compli ance Committee supports creation of  a form and method of notice "
that is streamlined across the Agencies via a highly secure delivery system to protect the 
extremely sensitive notification being conveyed.  The Compliance Commit tee also recommends 
that any form of notice and delivery system be optional and not mandatory given that security 
"incidents impact organizations in  different ways, and in some ca ses may interfere with access to "
"the particular system provided for notice. In su ch cases, organizations should not be penalized "
for failing to use a particular system  so long as good faith notice is made.
