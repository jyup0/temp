Dear Sir or Madam:  
  
The American Bankers Association (ABA)1 appreciates the opportunity to respond to the 
"January 2021 notice of proposed rulemaking, Computer -Security Incident Not ification "
"Requirements for Banking Organizations and Their Bank Service Providers  (“Proposal”), jointly "
"issued by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, "
                                                 
"1 The American Bankers Association is the voice of the nation’s $21.9 trillion banking industry, which is composed of "
"small, regional and large banks tha t together employ more than 2 million people, safeguard $17 trillion in deposits "
and extend nearly $11 trillion in loans. www.aba.com    
" 2 and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“Agencie s”).2  On behalf of our members, we "
welcome the opportunity for further engagement with the Agencies . We share the goal to 
"develop a flexible incident notification framework offering early awareness of disruptions, while "
also being appropriately scoped to avoid overreporting and unnecessary burden for the banking 
"industry, third party service providers, and the supervisory community.  "
 
The comments contained in this letter are the product of weekly meetings over 90 days of the 
"ABA Working Group, a diverse group o f ABA members composed of more than 100 people "
"representing 51 banks of varying asset sizes, charter types, and business models.3 This "
response is a summary of their thoughtful review and robust discussion reflecting on and 
"reacting to the Proposal. In support  of the collaborative spirit of the Proposal, the gro up took a "
pragmatic approach to consider how early awareness notification could be implemented in a 
"practical, effective manner while being operationally efficient for all financial institutions.  "
 
ABA and the ABA Working Group also fully support  the suggestions and 
"recommend ations made in the letter filed on behalf of ABA, Bank Policy Institute, "
"Institute of International Bankers, and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets "
Association  (“Associations”)  in response to th e Proposal .4 The ABA working group  
collaborated with  the Associations working group assuring both letters actively reflect a whole -
of-industry perspective. This letter is submitted as  a companion to the Association s’ letter 
offering further context re flective of the ABA working group’s diversity and operational expertise.  
 
On behalf of ABA’s members and our shared interest in enhancing the Proposal’s efficiency and 
"effectiveness, we respectfully encourage the Agencies to:  "
 
1) Continue acknowledging the im portance of voluntary notice within a larger and 
expanding notice schema;  
2) Recognize the conditional relationship between the sector’s assent to a 36 -hour 
"notice timeframe and the need for definitions, expectations, and implementation to be "
"clearly articul ated, consistently implemented, and aligned with the Proposal’s light "
touch -collaborative intent for early awareness notice of operational disruption;  
"3) Develop flexible notice options that are simple, concise, and utilize existing "
communication channels; an d  
4) Anticipate adoption over varying timelines as differing needs and compliance 
resources dictate how institutions will adapt and integrate a new bank service 
provider notice into existing 3rd party service provider relationships.

3 49% of the participating  institutions were community banks with less tha n $10B in assets.  28% of the participating 
institutions were among the largest 50 banks in the country based on asset size . The group also included two 
representatives from state banking associat ions. 
"4 This letter incorporates by reference the  comment letter signed by  ABA, Bank Policy Institute, Institute of "
"International Bankers, and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association  and affiliated a nnexes ( filed "
"April 12, 2021).   "
 3 I. Voluntary notice is e ssential to an efficient notification f ramework.  
 
"Within the evolving  notification landscape , there is an essential role for voluntary notice  "
"submitted according to a bank’s policies, procedur es, and business judgement that "
should continue to be acknowledged  and preserved. Voluntary notice incentivizes a bank 
to report beyond required incidents and offers further insight into sector security and 
disruption without mandates and compliance burden.  
 
The emerging notification schema would benefit from detailing h ow the Proposal 
complements current notification requirements coupled with a policy encouraging the 
desirable practice of voluntarily notifying on events falling outside of the scope of the 
Proposal. A common source of concern is the misperception that the  Proposal intends to 
"replace existing notice requirements with a short, fixed, prescriptive timeline.  There also "
"is concern that the Proposal is overbroad , and would create burdensome  overreporting "
contrary to the spirit of its articulated intent to provi de “early awareness” of severe and 
operationally debilitating occurrences .  This concern lies in the belief that the Proposal as 
"written would attach prescriptive mandatory reporting to an array of events, both the "
"actual, materially harmful and extraordin ary, as well as the merely possible or mundane. "
"In practice, this would compel banks to overreport nondisruptive events to their primary "
federal regulator as well as use limited resources to review voluminous overreports from 
bank service providers.  
 
"If the Proposal is reasonably scoped as recommended in the Associations letter,5 the "
acknowledgement of voluntary notice offers a mechanism to report events not causing 
institution -wide disruption or actual harm due to functioning business continuity plans 
"and sufficient controls and mitigation. These nondisruptive events, however, may be of a "
type or probability that the bank nonetheless choos es to notify according to internal 
"policy, procedure, or alignment with leading risk ma nagement practices. Establishing a "
clear distinction between mandatory and voluntary notice allows the Propo sal to be 
"appropriately tailored.  As a result, the proposed notice would focus  supervisory and "
"industry resources on actively or severely disruptive incidents, while preserving the  "
supervisory value of reporting nondisruptive events through an alternative voluntary 
mechanism and timeline.  
 
                                                 
"5 Assoc iations letter at 6. (Part II, C ) The Definition of “Notification Incident . Infra at 10 ( Part II, D)  The 36 -Hour "
"Timeframe for Notification . Infra at 14  (Part II, E) .  "
" 4 II. Implementing a 36 -hour notice period requires clarity, consistency, and "
alignment with the Proposal’s intent.  
 
The importance of early awarenes s and the underlying intent of the Proposal’s approach 
"is understood and appreciated. However, there remains cautious concern as to how the "
Proposal will be implemented and enforced.  
 
A. Industry is encouraged by the Proposal’s alignment with the standard 
definition of ‘Computer Security Incident.’  
 
In order to avoid the fragmentation observed in other areas of banking law and 
"supervision, it is an industry priority to harmonize cybersecurity regulation and "
"risk management with global standards. Banks across  the asset spectrum, from "
"community banks to the largest global financial firms, share this priority and "
"concern. The Agencies’ effort, as demonstrated in the Proposal, to rely on the "
definition of ‘computer security incident’ as used by the National Insti tute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST) is notable and appreciated. Industry is 
"encouraged to see the Agencies looking to global cybersecurity standards, and "
incorporating those well -known definitions into banking policy and regulations.    
 
"In this instan ce, where the definition of ‘computer security incident’ was "
developed for cybersecurit y and risk management purposes relative to issues 
"specifically involving the security of consumer information, industry acknowledges "
"that its use in the Proposal is neit her tidy, nor precise. However, the use of the "
"term as the first element within a larger notification analysis is adequate, and "
"avoids the construction of a similar, but differing term, that often leads to "
confusion and later regulatory fragmentation.6  
 
"B. In keeping with the spirit of the Proposal, the notification requirement should "
be limited to a set of discrete and rare events grounded in clear definitions 
and supervisory expectations.  
 
There is strong and diverse support to revise the Proposal to reflec t the 
"processes, deliberation, and investigation that an institution of any size would "
undertake before escalating a notice under the Proposal.7 These revis ions 
include r eplacing the term “believe” with “determine” in the definition of 
"“Notification Incid ent,” and  incorporating existing regulatory definitions of events "
that are reasonably likely to pose actual harm to an institution and can serve as 
‘landmarks’ in an institution’s pre -notice analysis.  
                                                 
"6 “We believe, however, that the term is workable in the proposed rule so long as the def inition of “notification "
"incident” is narrowly tailored…to achieve the rule’s objectives.” Associations letter at 6 “The Associations emphasize, "
"however, that if the NIST definition, which is the subject of ongoing discussion and analysis, is revised in th e future, "
"its definition within this rule should also be revised to maintain harmonization.” Infra at 6, FN 8 . "
7 This letter touches on elements of the Proposal to offer further context and examples. ABA and the ABA Working 
"Group support the full recommen dations  detailed in the Associations letter (fil ed April 12, 2021)  to refine and revi se "
the definition  of “Notification Incident. ”  
 5 1. Determination of “good faith” relies on facts and circ umstances.  
 
The moment a bank develops the “good faith” that a rare and discrete 
"incident has occurred is not based on a mere belief. Rather, “good faith” "
reflects the identification of an incident following a review of the facts and 
circumstances arising from an event or system anomaly.  
 
"In order to shape supervisory expectations, the proposed language "
should reflect the underlying operational and procedural  practices that 
would form the determination that notice under the Proposal is 
appropriate. This d etermination may require the participation of global 
staff across time zones while gleaning information and recommendations 
"from internal and external stakeholders, experts, and advisors.8 At the "
"same time, technical staff will be informing and deliberatin g with senior "
"leadership. Given the types of disruptive events identified in the Pr oposal, "
the board of directors would be engaged for the purpo se of notification 
"and concurrence.9  As these processes are necessary, often logistically "
"complex, and  may not occur  promptly, the Proposal’s “good faith” "
threshold should be revised to rely on the term “determined.”  
 
"2. Incorporating existing terms and definitions of discrete, rare, disruptive "
events will focus the scope of Notice incidents.  
 
"To better communicate t he types of events of concern, the proposed "
language may be enhanced by incorporating existing definitions from 
"banking law, regulation, and guidance to serve as signifiers or situational "
"landmarks of an event that is discrete, rare, and reasonably likely to pose "
actual disruptive harm to an institution.  These could include the Prompt 
"Corrective Action (PCA) capital category definitions,10 or the invocation of "
Sheltered Harbor protocols to restore critical operational data.11

"(October 19, 2020), https://www.fsb.org/wp -content/uploads/P191020 -1.pdf . Governance, at 4. “Governance frames "
the way in which [Cyber Incident Response and Recovery] is organised and managed...Governance involves defining 
"the decision -making framework with clear s teps and measures of success, and allocates responsibilities and "
accountabilities to ensure that the right internal and external stakeholders are engaged when a cyber incident occurs. 
Governance also encapsulates the commitment to support CIRR activities t hrough adequate sponsorship by senior 
"management and to promote positive behaviours dealing with, and following, a cyber incident.”   "
"Effective Practices, Planning and Preparation, at 7. “Organisations establish lists of internal and external stakeholders "
"to be informed depending on identified scenarios and criteria,  such as on the severity of the incident as well as any "
required regulatory and statutory notifications  [Emphasis added].”  
9 Depending on an institution’s governance policies and procedures. info rming the board of directors and obtaining 
their concurrence of a notification incident could be accomplished quickly by email or may be a more complex 
"process requiring a virtual meeting, phone call, or in -person meeting. The process, logistics, and timin g will differ for "
every institution.

"Corrective Action). Establishes five Prompt Corrective Action capital categories: well capitalized, adequat ely "
"capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized.  "

 6  Example:  
Notice Analysis with  PCA Capitalization Thresholds.  
 
Scenario: Ransomware incident. Institution determines in good 
faith to pay the ransom.  
 
i. Payment is of an amount  that is reasonably likely to cause 
the institution to become critically undercapitalized  under 
the PCA capital cat egory definitions creating an immediate 
safety and soundness event. The bank should give notice 
under the Proposal.  
 
ii. Payment is not of an amount reasonably likely to cause 
the institution to become undercapitalized. There is no 
actual harm to the institution’ s capital levels. The institution 
"would not notify under the Proposal. However, the institution "
may still notify:  
"1. Voluntarily to their primary federal or state regulator, in any "
instance;  
"2. As mandated by their state regulator, if required.  "
3. According to  regulations promulgated  under the Gramm -
Leach -Bliley Act to inform  a primary feder al regulator if 
"consumer data may be involved,12 or "
4. Subject to FinCEN’s mandatory or voluntary cyber 
"Suspicious Activity Reports (SARS ), as appropriate.13  "
"Incorporating well -known banking regulations that define discrete, rare, "
and severely disruptive elements further clarifies th e scope of the 
"Proposal, and brings a sense of familiarity to analysis and "
implementation.

" 7 III. Notice should be flexible, simple, concise, and rely on existing "
communication channels.  
 
The Proposal’s intent to establish flexible and easy notice is welcome.14 Other notice 
considerations may include the ability to rescind and the ability to request a record of 
notice. Inst itutions may need a mechanism to rescind when initial determinations 
overestimate the severi ty or significance of an event or an institution may need to 
"request a record of notice for insurance purposes, especially if notice is delivered by "
phone or in -person. Notice from a financial institution to their primary federal regulator 
"should be simple, concise, and use existing communication channels.  "
 
The incident notice framework should be  adequately flexible to accommodate  delivery 
"through spontaneous and nontraditional channels.  In an extreme disruption scenario, "
notice may need to rely on whatever communication channel is functioning. This may  
include delivery by phone or email. It may also include in -person delivery to on -site 
examiners or staff at a regional office; through an unsecured personal phone or device; 
"or submitted on an existing secure channel, such as FDIConnect. In all instances,  a bank "
should retain the ability to select a method of delivery based on the facts and 
circumstances of the disruption and the topography of the underlying incident.  
 
IV. Adoption and integration of bank service provider notice will vary with 
contract terms a nd compliance resources.  
 
The Proposal’s notice obligation for bank service providers is a significant step towards 
"creating a more balanced relationship among financial institutions, the federal banking "
"regulators, and third party service providers. The b anking industry is supportive of the "
"creation of a third party notice obligation in concept, and appreciates the direct "
"application of notice requirements, enforcement, and liability for noncompliance on those "
third parties covered under the Proposal.  This is especially  important for institutions that 
may have relatively less ability to impose new and potentially costly contractual 
obligations on their third party service providers in comparison to larger institutions with 
often greater leverage  in negotiati ons.  
 
                                                 
14 ABA recognizes that each federal banking regulator may further refine the Proposal through agency -specific notice 
parameters. We welcome these opportunities fo r further engagement and discussion of the elements and methods of 
notice.   
 8 
Implementation timelines and supervisory expectations for third party notice should 
consider time and costs for contract review and revision. Although contracts may include 
"a standard “compliance with all laws” clause, most contracts do not have language "
mirroring the Proposal requirements : 
" When  a bank service contract includes standard breach language,15 it is not "
uncommon for notice to be re quired from a service provider within 24 hours. 
"However, standard breach language may not include many of the non -data, "
operational disruption scenarios contemplated under the Proposal.  
" Where contracts require notice for operational disruption, notice to t he bank may "
not be required for several days or we eks after an event.  
 
"The ABA Working Gr oup reported that reviewing, revising , and successfully negotiating  "
all service provider contracts through an institution’s usual procurement review process 
"would require a significant amount of time (i.e., on average from 18 months to 2 years ). "
Additional time may be needed if a bank elects to update contractual language at the 
"time of contract expiration, which can be a term of 5 -years for many critical serv ices, "
such as core banking systems.16 Additional costs include contact review and revision 
"services of in -house procurement and third party risk teams, as well as internal and "
"external experts, s uch as legal counsel to review existing contract terms, prepar e, and "
negotiate  new contract language  incorporating the Proposal’s notification requirements .17 
Adoption a nd implementation will require an extended time after the Proposal is final for 
contract review and revision.

ABA appreciates the opportunity to respond to the Proposal. Given the ABA Working 
Group’s robust engagement and o ngoing interest in developing an effective and efficient 
"incident notification framework, we wel come the opportunity to collaborate further with "
"the Agencies on the Proposal. Please contact me with questi ons, or to engage with the "
ABA Working Group .

15 Not all contracts include standard breach language. The ABA Working Group reported significant variation in the 
presence and substance of breach language across third party service contracts. An assumption that all contracts 
contain breach noti ce is inaccur ate.  
"16 In some instances, banks are  prohibited from revisi ng terms during a contract period, or alternatively,  must  request "
"modification coupled with a  significant renegotiation fee. Hence, many banks, particularly community banks, will elect "
only to revise contract language according to the renegotiation schedul e set by the natural termination of a contract.  
17 The ABA Working Group reported substantial reliance on external experts and consultants to manage negotiations 
"and offer legal review of third -party service contracts . Use of external expertise is reflectiv e of many factors , including "
the size of the i nstitution as well as the complexity  and novelty of the third p arty service being contracted.
