 Dear Sir or Madam:  
" We write in support of the purpose and the direction  of, while also providing specific comments "
"and further recommendations with respect to,  the abovementioned Notice of Proposed "
"Rulemaking as published in 86 Federal Register 2299, dated January 12, 2021  (the “NPRM”) by "
"the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), Board of Governors of the Federal "
"Reserve System (“Board”) ; and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), collectively "
"referred herein as the “Federal Banking Agencies .”  Unless  otherwise specifically indicate d, the "
"comments are directed equally to each of the OCC, Board, and FDIC; moreover, we believe it essential that such a regulatory proposal not only be implemented consistently across the Federal Banking Agencies, but also that the policy purpose would be better served by complementary efforts involving a broader group of Federal and State regulatory and "
supervisory authorities.  
I. Executive Summary of Conclusion  
The first notification requirement by a banking organization to its primary Federal regulator as 
"an “early alert” is reasonable and appropriate, and will further the missions of the Federal "
Banking Agencies as well as serve with minimal costs incrementally to help protect individual 
banking organizations and potentially against broader financial stability  risks.  The second 
"notification requirement for bank service providers is also reasonable, and in fact is a necessary "
prerequisite for the banking organizations relying on such services to carry o ut effective risk 
management as well as more effectively  fulfilling the banking organizations ’ own notification 
"requirement.  It is also reasonable to have th ese two distinct notification requirements , "
because it is correct that bank service providers generally are not in a position to evaluate the 
"potential impact for their banking organization customers . For example, the same service  Comments of M arket Integrity Solutions LLC "

" offering could be critical to one banking organization in terms of profits and customer utilization, but "
entirely marginal to the business of another banking organization.  (A subset of service providers such as for a core banking system might more easily assume that an incident would be material to its 
customers.)  It is also reasonable for the Federal Banking Agencies to expect initial notifications to be 
provided within a relatively short period of time.  One of the major change in connection with 
"technological innovation is to provide financial services with faster services (e.g., real- time payments); "
"thus an incident can immediately have an impact, and supervisor s rightfully would wish for an initial "
"early alert, long before they might be able to expect a more detailed impact analysis which will be specific to the incident.  "
While it is understandable that the Federal Banking Agencies frame th ese proposed notificat ion 
requirements in significant part under the authority of the Bank Service Company Ac t – in part icular 
related to notification of service relationships and examination authority for contract providers  – such  
framework is not consistent with the way either banking organizations or their service providers manage 
"potential risks with respect to their relationship.  As a result, the second notification requirement  as "
"proposed  is not well defined in its scope, and could be made more effective through further c larification "
"in relation to complementary outsourcing risk management requirements, for which the re is additional "
"precedent, and ongoing initiatives, including cu rrent international efforts that should be instructive.  "
II. About the Commenters  
"This comment is s ubmitted by Market Integrity Solutions, LLC , a consulting firm providing executive "
"advice on global financial regulation and innovative technology solutions , and by  RS Technologies , LLC , a "
"FinTech company (Mark Stetler, CEO) providing anti -money laundering solutions to the banking industry .  "
"The primary author is Market Integrity Solution’s  founder, James H. Freis, Jr. , a global expert in financial "
"regulation, with a career dedicated to protecting the integrity of th e financial markets.  Mr. Freis was the "
longest -serving Director (CEO) of the United States Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement 
"Network (FinCEN), the lead U.S. Government official for anti- money laundering and counter -terrorist "
"financing req uirements  in close cooperation with the Federal Banking Agencies and other Federal, State "
"and international financial sector supervisors.  FinCEN is also the agency responsible for collecting, analyzing, and disseminating Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs)  from banking organizations , and Mr. "
Freis agrees with and confirms th e discussion in the NPRM that such SAR reporting does not fulfill the 
purpose sought under the NPRM.
1  In addition to his experience working at the U.S. Department of the 
"Treasury and t he Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Mr. Freis served seven years at the Bank for "
"International Settlements (BIS) in Basel, Switzerland, and six years with the Deutsche B örse Group based "
"in Frankfurt  am Main, Germany, with a leading global provider of syst emically significant financial "
"market infrastructures, where among other things he was a member of the executive leadership "
ensuring appropriate risk management over critical outsourcings in particular to technology service 
providers.  He has most recently been associated with Fin Tech  companies providing services including 
some of  which would fall under the scope of the proposed notification requirements.

forensic audit audit firms that served the mortgage origination and mortgage servicing markets founded 
in 1985.   
Messrs. Freis and Stetler have e valuated options for technology solutions which could fulfill the 
"proposed notification requirements of the NPRM in an efficient and cost -effective way, while also "
fulfilling broader policy interests and considerations as discussed in this comment letter.   On the basis of 
"our relevant experience and that specific analysis, we conclude th at the overall benefits of the proposed "
notification requirement s wou ld exceed the overall costs.  
III. Summary Views on Pol icy Objectives and Other Relevant Initiatives 
"We strongly support the policy direction of this NPRM, which should result in:  "
• Increased focus by banking organizations  on the evolving risks of their reliance on bank 
"service providers and outsourcing more generally, which  increasingly involves "
technology service providers ; 
• Greater awareness and responsiveness among the class of bank service providers  in 
working with banking organization in terms of preparatory planning for possible service 
"outages, as well as in response to incidents; and  "
"• Greater insight of financial supervisors  over risks to individual institutions, as well as "
"more broadly across regulated banking organizations and their service pro viders, in "
particular through risks of concentration on certain providers or sub -contractors.  
"In order  to make this regulatory framework more effective , the Federal Banking Agencies should:  "
 Align the NPRM and guidance thereunder not merely with the relativ ely obscure provisions 
"of the Bank Service Company Act, but rather more closely with the body of complementary "
"regulatory expectations relating to outsourcing, in particular with respect to technology "
service providers ; 
o This can be achieved in a practical way through more detailed focus on the 
"proposed new definition of bank service provider, which as currently drafted does "
"not provide sufficient notice to , or clarity about, the entities subject to the new "
obligations ; 
" Emphasize that while this initiative largely reflects risks related to technology developments, "
that banking organizations should not misinterpret th ese obligations narrowly in terms of 
"cybersecurity, but rather more importantly from the perspective of the impact s upon their  "
"business  (again, reminiscent of outsourcing more broadly) ; "
 Develop these specific regulations in the context of overdue modernization of  the 
"outsourcing guidance and related regulatory expectations, for which insights can be drawn "
from evolving international norms ; 
 While respectful of the limit ations of  the authority of the Federal Banking Agencies  and not 
"wishing to delay their initiative in this regard, coordinate with  other Federal and State "
"financial supervisors, particularly due to the fact that  a significant num ber of underlying "
bank service pr oviders are likely to also contract with  financ ial services providers not Comments of M arket Integrity Solutions LLC

" licensed by the Federal Banking Agencies , which in turn would complement the policy "
purpose and benefits sought by the Federal Banking Agencies.  
"Rega rding the specific reporting obligations proposed in the NPRM , we be lieve : "
 The proposed notification requirements are  not sufficiently cover ed by existing regulatory 
obligations  (in particular those with respect to outsourcing which are not sufficiently 
fulfilled in light of the evolving risk);  
" Focus should be on areas of higher risk , not all service provider relationships, which again "
parallels the risk -based focus of outsourcin g management ; and  
" The implementation of a structure for the notification requirements, both on behalf of "
"banking organizations and bank service providers , lend themselves to a type of industry "
"initiative or share d approach, rather than ad hoc measures by e ach entity, which approach "
would not only be more efficient and effective  but would also better facilitate the Federal 
Banking Agencies ’ objective of gaining insights into broader financial stability risks . 
IV. Proposed Notification Requirements Can Be Most Efficient and Effective in 
Complement to Other Policy Initiatives 
A. Impact upon Business Operations  
We recommend that the Federal Banking Agencies more clearly emphasize that while this initiative 
"largely reflects risks related to technology development s, nonetheless,  banking organizations should not "
"misinterpret these obligations narrowly in terms of cybersecurity, but rather more importantly from the "
perspective of the impacts upon their business .  The definition of “notification incident” makes clear 
"that the focus involves impact on business operations, yet the NPRM preamble introduction begins with "
a discussion of the more narrow issue of cyberattacks. Care should be taken with the rollout of any final 
regulation that responsibility for these issues should best be in connection with management and board  
"responsibility for business critical outsourcings , as described further below . "
B. Relevance to FinTech Oversight  and White -labelled Services  
"More generally, o ne of the more pressing regulatory challenges spurred by technological innovation are "
initiatives of companies which may be categorized broadly as “FinTechs.”  S ome FinTech companies may 
seek to employ technology to provide one or more aspects of fina ncial services in a more efficient and 
cost-effecti ve way by emplo ying modern technology to  thereby compete with or to “disrupt” traditional 
financial services providers and/or aspects of their business models.  Such companies might fall under 
"regulatory and licensing requirements on a functional basis, particularly as they expand the range of "
"products or services offered, in some case s eventually seeking a banking license.  "
"Increasingly, however, many FinTechs are partnering with (or even being acquired by) traditional "
banking organizations or other license d financial services providers.  Certain FinTechs are likely falling 
"within the scope of the Bank Service Company Act and its examination authority, as well as the NPRM’s "
"proposed notification requirements for bank service providers. Moreover, many banking organizations "
"are increasingly relying on specialized external parties offering components of banking as well as permissible non -banking services which , as discussed below  in the comment with respect to NPRM item  "
"10 definition of bank service companies , also fall within the scope of the Bank Service Company Act.   The Comments of M arket Integrity Solutions LLC "

 Federal Banking Agencies are urged to consider th e foregoing  as part of their overall approach and 
available “toolbox” to risk mitigation  related to emerging technology innovations  by banking 
"organizations, their service partners, and new types of competitors.  "
C. Coordination with Other Interested Supervisory Authorities  
The policy interests underlying the NPRM are not unique to the Federal Banking Agencies nor the 
"banking organizations supervised by them.  Rather, multiple other Federal and State financial "
"supervisors have shown similar interest , and it would further the financial stability interests of the  "
"Federal Banking Agencies if complementary initiatives were advanced .  Moreover, a significant number "
of underlying bank service providers are likely also to contract with financial services providers not 
"licensed by the Federal Banking Agencies , meaning t hat the greatest systemic risks could better be "
"addressed by a coordinated approach, in particular involving the confidential exchange of information "
among regulators with respect to risks and incidents.  
"A bill before the current U.S. Congress, the Bank Se rvice Company Examination Coordination Act, H.R. "
"2270 (introduced March 26, 2021), following upon similar proposals introduced in previous Congresses, "
would expand coordination and information with State banking supervisors.  The passing of this 
legislatio n and its ensuing implementation would further the purpose of the NPRM.  Such coordination 
is particularly appropriate in light of the fact that the majority of States already have examination 
authority similar to that of the Federal Banking Agencies.2  State regulators also serve as primary 
"licensing authorities for a range of financial services providers, including insurance companies  and "
"money transmitters, which may serve as critical service providers to entities licensed by the Federal "
Banking Agencie s. 
The Federal Banking Agencies  already  coordinate interagency programs to supervise third -party 
servicers through the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC).3  The National Credit 
Union Administration (NCUA) does not have independent regulatory authority over technology service providers .
"4  Consideration could also be given to formalizing such authority for the NCUA, as there is no "
reason why its supervisory i nterests should diverge from those of the Federal Banking Agencies; if 
"anything, credit unions are at least if not more reliant on external service providers than many banks.   "
Reference is also made to the notification requirement s under the Securit ies an d Exchange 
"Commission’s  (SEC) Regulation System s Compliance and Integrity (Regulation SCI) which  was developed, "
"inter alia , in light of the dependency of the securities markets on evolving technology and vulnerabilities "
"to outages including in connection w ith cyberattacks .5 Notably, a covered entity is required both to "

 make an “immediate” notification to its Federal regulator of an incident ; followed within 24 hours  on a 
"“good faith, best efforts basis” by a notification of event and assessment to the extent available at that "
time;  and at later times more detailed impact assessments.6 This approach is generally consistent with 
"the “early alert” approach in the NPRM of the immediate notification by a bank service  provide r, and "
subsequent notification by a banking organization  after it believes in good faith that a reportable 
"incident has occurred.  While as compared to the NPRM of the Federal Banking Agencies, the SEC  "
Regulation SCI  is much broader in content while  more limited in applicat ion to certain  of its regulated 
"entities,7 the more detailed framework of Regulation SCI is more appropriate for Financial Market "
Utilities (FMUs) – this responds to the NPRM request for comment item 6 about unique factors in how 
best to apply notificatio n requirements to FMUs.  
"The primary author of this comment letter, in his role as form er FinCEN Director, can personally attest to "
"his direct, successful experience in coordination, as well as delegating regulatory examination "
"experience to State authoriti es, in addition to the Federal Banking Agencies and other Federal financial "
services regulators .  We believe that while the Federal Banking Agencies should proceed with this 
"proposal, they should seek continually to expand coordination and appropriate info rmation sharing "
relevant to risks with a broad range of other Federal and State regulators.  Such complementary efforts 
"would better promote the purpose of the NPRM , and also c lose potential  gaps in understanding possible "
risks to financial stability as well as opportunities for regulatory arbitrage .  While it is believed that the 
multiple licensing and chartering opportunities in the  U.S. financial system can promote competition 
"and in turn innova tion, the ability to manage critical dependencies and deal with incidents is an area for "
"regulatory cooperation, not for regulatory competition ( such as a race to the bottom) .  Cooperation "
"would serve to l evel the playing field  for relevant risks, and promote financial stability oversight through "
"a more comprehensive view of risks, especially in light of underlying technology providers servicing "
multiple classes of licensed entities.  
D. Draw Upon Complementary Outsourcing Risk Management Framework  
The NPRM ’s content is very closely related to the regulatory expectations of the Federal Banking 
"Agencies with respect to outsourcing risk management, yet there is no material reference thereto in the "
NPRM.8  “Outsourcing” is defined in the FFIEC IT Examination Handb ook as : “The practice of contracting 
"through a formal agreement with a third -party(ies) to perform services, functions, or support that might "
otherwise be conducted in -house. ”9 The first paragraph of the introduction to the FFIEC IT Booklet 
entitled “Outs ourcing Technology Services” is very similar to the policy interests expressed in the NPRM:  
The financial services industry has changed rapidly and dramatically. Advances in technology 
"enable institutions to provide customers with an array of products, ser vices, and delivery "
channels. One result of these changes is that financial institutions increasingly rely on external 
 
comm ent letter previously had oversight responsibility for the implementation of Regulation SCI by SEC regulated 
exchanges.  
6 See 17 CFR § 242.1002(b).  
"7 See 79 Fed. Reg. at 72,256 (noting SEC estimate of 44 entities being subject to the SCI proposal).  "
8 The t erm “outsourcing” only appears once in the NPRM. See 86 Fed. Reg. at 2308 (“The Board is unable to 
estimate the number of bank service providers that are small due to the varying types of banking organizations 
that may enter into outsourcing arrangements w ith bank service providers.”).  
"9 See Glossary definition of “Outsourcing”, available at FFIEC IT Examination Handbook InfoBase -  Glossary  Comments of M arket Integrity Solutions LLC "

" service providers for a variety of technology -related services. Generally, the term ""outsourcing"" "
is used to describe these types of arra ngements.10 
The Federal Banking Agencies also do not in the NPRM make reference to their guidance (notably more 
narrow than the scope of the BSCA) specific to technology aspects of bank service providers:  the 2012  
FFIEC IT Examination Handbook on “Supervi sion of Technology Service Providers”11 (the “TSP Booklet”).  
"Albeit somewhat dated, the Outsourcing Technology Services Handbook contains critically important "
principles in light of the NPRM’s focus on the business relevance of proposed “notification incident s.”  
The first section of that  Handbook following the introduction states:  
The responsibility for properly overseeing outsourced relationships lies with the institution's board of directors and senior management.  Although the technolo gy needed to support 
"business objectives is often a critical factor in deciding to outsource, managing such "
relationships is more than just a technology issue; it is an enterprise -wide corporate 
management issue. An effective outsourcing oversight program should provide the framework 
"for management to identify, measure, monitor, and control the risks associated with "
outsourcing. The board and senior management should develop and implement enterprise -wide 
policies to govern the outsourcing process consistent ly. These policies should address 
"outsourced relationships from an end -to-end perspective, including establishing servicing "
"requirements and strategies; selecting a provider; negotiating the contract; and monitoring, changing, and discontinuing the outsour ced relationship.  "
The NPRM’s proposed notification requirement would appear to be a minor additional step upon a 
banking organization’s  robustly implemented outsourcing framework.  
"There is, however, ample reason to doubt that banking organiz ations having consistently implemented "
"the existing outsourcing requirements , certainly at the level of the above -quoted management and "
"board attention, and in light of the evolving reliance on technol ogy and breadth of contracted services.   "
"Note, for example, the evaluation  result s of the FDIC Office of Inspector General:  "
"We did not see evidence, in the form of risk assessments or contract due diligence, that most of "
the FDIC -supervised [financial inst itutions ( FIs)] we reviewed fully considered and assessed the 
potential impact and risk that [technology service providers ( TSPs )] may have on the FI’s ability 
to manage its own business continuity planning and incident response and reporting operations. 
"Typically, FI contracts with TSPs did not clearly address TSP responsibilities and lacked specific contract provisions to protect F I interests or preserve FI rights. Contracts also did not sufficiently "
"define key terminology related to business continuity and incident response. As a result, FI contracts with TSPs we reviewed provided FIs with limited information and assurance that TSP s "
"(1) could recover and resume critical systems, services, and operations timely and effectively if "

 disrupted; and (2) would take appropriate steps to contain and control incidents and report 
them timely to appropriate parties.12 
The FDIC  subsequently advised regulated institutions of ongoing observations of deficiencies in this 
regard .13 
V. International Financial Regulatory Focus on Outsourcing and Technology Risks 
While the Federal Banking Agencies were early adopters and proponents of req uirements that banking 
"institutions manage risks related to outsourcing and , in particular, technology services providers, the  "
"U.S. guidance could be updated in light of the emerging supervisory norms, including as relevant to the "
notification requirements  in the NPRM.  More recent outsourcing guidance has generally been 
"narrower, such  as related to cybersecurity and cloud services, but the NPRM seeks to focus on broader "
risks.  
The FFIEC issued its Technology Examination Handbook (IT Handbook) “Outsourcing Technology Services 
Booklet” (booklet) in June 2004.14 This significantly influenced the first global effort among financial 
"supervisors  in guidance issued  by the Joint Forum in 2005.15  On November 9, 2020 , the Financial "
Stability Board (FSB) issued for public consultation a discussion  paper on the topic of “Regulatory and 
"Supervisory Issues Relating to Outsourcing and Third -Party Relationships ,” largely building upon the "
framework estab lished in the 2005 Joint Forum guidelines.16  The context of the FSB consultation was 
"the financial industry’s increasing reliance on third parties, particularly in the area of technology, with "
challenges further accelerated through the COVID -19 experience.  Common themes raised by multiple 
comments in response to the consultation include:  
"• advocating the need for a coordinated supervisory approach, including more consistent "
"definitions of key terms, particularly on a cross -border basis ; "
 
"12 See FDIC Office of Inspector General , Report No. EVAL -17-004, “Technology Service Provider Contracts with "
"FDIC -Supervised Institutions ” (February 2017)  (emphasis added) , available at:   Technology Service Provider "
Contracts with FDIC -Supervised Institutions | Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Ofﬁce of Inspector General  
(fdicoig.gov)  
"13 See FDIC, Financial Institution Letter FIL -19-2019 (April 2, 2019) entitled “Technology Service Provider "
Contracts”:  
Examiners have noted in recent FDIC reports of examination that some financial institution contracts with 
technology servi ce providers may not adequately define rights and responsibilities regarding business 
"continuity and incident response, or provide sufficient detail to allow financial institutions to manage "
those processes and risks.  
14 Available at ffiec_itbooklet_outsourcingtechnologyservices.pdf .  Note also the introductory paragraph as 
consistent with the risks indicated over sixteen years later in this NPRM:  
The financial services industry has changed rapidly and dramatically. Advances in technology enable 
"institutions to provide customers with an array of products, services, and delivery channels. One result of "
these changes is that financial institutions increas ingly rely on external service providers for a variety of 
"technology -related services. Generally, the term “outsourcing” is used to describe these types of "
arrangements.

comment letter was working at the Bank for International Settlements during the development of this report.

 • practical difficultie s (or the potential for unrealistic expectations) related to sub -outsourcings 
"(sometimes referred to a “fourth -party” issues), particularly in a service provided in a common "
way to multiple customers ; and  
• potential conflicts with data localization initiatives o r efforts to limit cross -border transfers of 
data . 
"Regarding the challenges for financial institutions overseeing their risks with third -party providers, "
"banking associations advocated possible mitigants through:  joint industry audits, direct supervisor "
"oversight of third party service provide rs, or development of certification schemes.   While going beyond "
"the scope of the NPRM, the policy objectives of this consultation and the comments in response are "
consistent with those  being pursued by the Federal Banking Agencies.  The consultation and 
comments  also lend support to the main themes of this comment letter  that the specific NPRM 
proposal must be considered in the context of other domestic and global complementary initiati ves; 
"and, that the second notification requirement with respect to bank service providers needs to better "
articulate the affected entities  in order to improve its effectiveness.  
The most important specific new regulatory requirements in another jurisdictio n related to outsourcing 
are the European Banking Authority’s (EBA) 2019 publication of the “EBA Guidelines on Outsourcing 
Arrangements.”17 While not specifying notification requirements akin to the NPRM (which would be 
"within the purview of regional and n ational supervisors), in addition to the general outsourcing context, "
we wish to draw attention to the definition s of critical outsourcing  and to the focus on sub -outsourcing.  
"In the NPRM, the Federal Banking Agencies suggest the ability of certain banking  organizations to rely "
"upon their resolution planning for identifying core business lines and critical operations ; in contrast, "
banking institutions not subje ct to the Resolution Planning Rule are not required to identify these  solely 
"for the purpose of th e proposed notification requirements .  “However, the agencies do expect all  "
banking organizations to have a  sufficient understanding of their lines of business to be able to notify 
"the appropriate agency of notification  incidents that could result in a mat erial loss of revenue, profit, or "
franchise  value to the banking organization. ”18  The EBA Guidelines have requirements with respect to 
the identification and risk management of outsourcing of “critical or important functions” which include meeting licensing obligations;  affecting a bank’s  financial performance; or  the soundness or continuity 
of their banking a nd payment services .
19 The second and third points in the EBA Guidelines are 
consistent with the first two prongs of the notification incident definition.  To the extent the Federal 
Banking Agencies choose to focus the notification requirements to areas of greater risk or a materiality  
"standard , it would be useful to consider the evolving understanding of critical outsourcings, such as "
consistent with the EBA Guidelines.  
"Sub- outsourcing , as noted in each of the FSB consultation and the EBA Guidelines, is an  evolving area of "
"concern and also challenge for all parties concerned: supervisors, banking organizations, and bank "
"service providers.  This issue goes beyond the scope of the notification proposals in the NPRM, but it is "

" mentioned in that the Federal Ban king Agencies , as part of a more holistic approach to und erstanding "
"and addressing outsourcing risks, should give future attention to this topic.  "
"The international examples  should not merely be considered as an example s, but rather are directly "
"relevant to various aspects of an effective approach  by the Federal Banking Agencies, including because:  "
• many banking organizations that would be subject to the proposed rules are also subject to 
these foreign regulations;  and particularly with respect to critical outsourcing may fall und er 
groupwide risk management approaches; and  
"• many of the bank service providers , including global leading technology service providers,  also "
service non-U.S. institutions .

"The Federal Banking Agencies should support the development of, and reliance by banking organizations and by bank services providers, on collaborative solutions to meet their notification obligations , "
including standardized reporting formats .  In the event of a computer -security incident giving rise to 
"time -critical notification, based on the short timelines, there is  no ability to then consider what if any "
reporting notifications might arise .  Each reporting entity  should be able to evidence on an ongoing basis 
"that it has structured processes and procedures; responsible and accountable personnel; and reliable communi cations channels in place to the meet the notification requirements , review of which should be "
included as appropriate in supervisory examinations.  
"Regarding how  to provide notifications , and to whom at the Federal Banking Agencies, it is "
"recommended that notification be made electronically, in writing and subject to recordkeeping and "
"audit trail.  S uch communication should be made to one central point of contact , ideally using a shared "
"service such as under the auspices of the FFIEC, but at a minimum to on e central notification node "
within each Federal Banking Agency.  Such central point of contact  should in turn be responsible for 
disseminating to responsible persons  within the agency or among cooperating supervisory authorities . 
"(The foregoing would not p reclude, for example, a bank ing organization from promptly informing its "
"primary contact(s) in its specific supervisory team(s), but it is recommended that the regulatory "
requirement for notification be met through notifying a central agency point  of conta ct.) Comments of M arket Integrity Solutions LLC

 We also recommend with respect to the communications channels for delivering notifications : 
"• for all parties involved – be it a bank service company (or its sub -contractor), a banking "
"organization, or a regulator; the notification obligation should be as automated as possible and "
not interrupt in particular the subject matter expert individuals or managers who should be 
focusing their attention on remediation or mitigating the risks of the computer- security 
"incident, which by definition raises potentially material risks for the banking organization;  and "
• because bank service providers generally are expected to provide services for multiple banking 
"organizations, it must be assumed that a computer -security incident could impact multiple "
"banking organizations, thus requiring multiple notifications; as a matter of efficiency, a collaborative notification system wou ld be more efficient than  bilateral communications.  "
Consideration should also be given to the fact that in the event of a computer -security incident 
"impacting a bank service provider, the normal communication channels of such bank service provider to its customer banking organization might also be interrupted.  For example, if the bank service provider "
"provides externally hosted software services, the banking organization might in the normal course "
receive ongoing reporting about the functioning of that ser vice.  In the event of a computer -security 
incident that might generically be referred to as an outage – equivalent to a total software outage or 
interruption of connectivity lines or power outage –  this could also effectively take offline the normal 
commu nication channel from the bank service provide to the banking organization.  As another 
"example, if the computer -security incident involved an interruption by the bank’s internet service "
"provider, the bank might not be able to use its normal electronic com munications channels with its "
"regulators.  Hence, in all cases, consideration should be given to a type of business continuity measure, "
"or alternate reporting channel, for each of bank service providers and banking organizations to make their notification requirements under the proposed rules.  "
The Federal Banking Agencies need not be prescriptive with respect to the content or means of the 
"notification (separate from providing a central point of contact).  Rather, this is a good opportunity for "
industry to come up with efficient solutions and improve them over time.  
Comment Item 10. Proposed definition of “bank service provider”  
The definition of “bank service provider” in the proposed rule is not sufficiently clear.  An ambiguous 
"definition  risks , first,  that the “other persons ” providing services under contract to a banking "
organization s do not have sufficient notice that the Federal Banking Agencies are applying by regulation 
"the NPRM’s notification obligations upon them, thus raising questions of due proc ess and fairness , while "
"also potentially undermining the purpose of those obligations .  Secondly, banking organi zations face "
ambiguity with respect to which of their contractual service providers are intended to fall within the 
"obligations under the rule , again risking undermining the policy purpose . "
"The term “bank service provider” has not previously been defined in the Co de of Federal Regulations, "
nor is it a specifically defined term such as in relevant FFIEC examination handbooks.  The proposed 
definition is:  Comments of M arket Integrity Solutions LLC 
NPRM on Computer -Security Incident Notification Requi rements  
12 
 Bank service provider  means a bank service company or other person providing services to a 
banking organization th at is subject to the Bank Services Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1861- 1867).20 
The subset of “bank service company” is a reas onably defined class in light of the BSCA definition based 
on ownership by a banking organization and the supervisory oversight and approv al in connection with 
such ownership.21  The ambiguous part of the proposed definition is “other person providing services to 
a banking organization that is subject to the Bank Services Company Act.”  The term  “banking 
organization” is defined in the propo sed rule  immediately proceeding and the scope of this definition is 
"separately the subject of requests for comments numbers 6, 7, and 8 of the proposed rule.  Thus, the "
ambiguous phrase can be further reduced to clarify the pre sumed meaning of the determin er “that ”:  
“other person providing services … subject to the Bank Services Company Act.”   
From the year 1962 when the Bank Service Company Act (“BSCA”) was adopted with its references to 
"“bank services ,” there has been significant expansion in the allowable business of banking .  This has "
"occurred  through distinct legislative amendments as well as regulatory interpretations; and, "
"furthermore, the application of these authorities to evolving technology supporting financial services.  In short, the BSC A itself contains language from a legacy era (e.g., with respect to checks and their physical "
mailing) predating modern financial services; and is focused primarily on the more limited allowable 
services for companies owned by regulated banking organizatio ns.
22  The more relevant issues for the 
purpose of the NPRM are how the Federal Banking Agencies from a modern technology perspective 
"interpret the 12 U.S.C. § 1863 language of “any other clerical, bookkeeping, accounting, statistical, or "
similar functions  performed for a depository institution ” being permissible for a bank service company 
"or performed under contract , in each case subject to examination under 12 U.S.C. §  1867.23  One of the "
"more recent (2019) interpretations of the FDIC , notes that services “similar” to those enumerated in the "
"BSCA provision (otherwise unchanged since its adoption in 1962 ) include  “Internet banking, or mobile "
banking services .”24 
 
20 The proposed definition language is identical in each of proposed OCC §  53.2(b)(2); Boa rd § 225.301(a) [note this 
is not numbered as subsection (a)(2) as internally cross -referenced in proposed §  222.300(c)]; and FDIC 
§ 304.22(b)(2).  
"21 See, e.g., 12 CFR § 5.35 (describ ing the procedures and requirements regarding OCC review and approval of a "
notice by a national bank or Federal savings association to invest in the equity of a  bank service company) . 
22 See 12 U.S.C. §  1861(b) (defining “bank service company”).  
23 Note that th e opinions expressed herein are meant to apply also with respect to services performed by savings 
"association service companies, subsidiaries or by contract, subject to similar oversight as under the BSCA, in "
accordance with 12 U.S.C. § 1464(d)(7).  
"24 See F DIC, Financial Institution Letter FIL -19-2019 (April 2, 2019) entitled “Technology Service Provider "
"Contracts”, referring to the BSCA notification requirements, available at fil19019.pdf (fdic.gov) : "
"Section 7 of the Bank Service Company Act (Act) (12 U.S.C. 1867) requires depository institutions to notify, "
"in writing, their respective federal banking agency of contracts or relationships with technology service "
provider s that provide certain services. Services covered by Section 3 of the Act include check and deposit 
"sorting and posting, computation and posting of interest, preparation and mailing of checks or "
"statements, and other clerical , bookkeeping, accounting, stat istical, or similar functions such as data "
"processing, Internet banking, or mobile banking services . "
(emphasis added).  
"Cf. the original language of the BSCA, Pub. L. 87- 856:  "

"and posting of interest and other credits and charges, preparation and mailing of checks, statements, Comments of M arket Integrity Solutions LLC "

 The preamble to the NPRM suggests that the Federal Banking Agencies intend the definition “bank 
service provider” to be applied broadly  to a range of modern contractual services providers .25 The NPRM 
"text accompanying footnote 14 quotes the antiquated language of the BSCA, and notes that the bank "
services subject to the BSCA also include “components that underlie these activities.”26 The NPRM 
"continues:  “Other services that are subject to the BSCA include data processing, back office services, "
"and activities related to credit extensions, as well as components that underlie these activities.”27  "
Footnote 15 further details that such services mu st be permissible for bank holding companies under 
"the Bank Holding Company Act and implementing under 12 CFR §  225.28 , listing the fourteen c ategories "
of nonbanking activities which have been defined and refined over decades as “so closely related to 
"bank ing or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incide nt thereto, ” and therefore permissible "
to be engaged in by a  bank holding company  or its  subsidiary .28 The last such subcategory of  permissible 
"nonbanking activities is “data processing,” described  in th at regulation as:  "
"(i) Providing data processing, data storage and data transmission services, facilities (including "
"data processing, data storage and data transmission hardware, software, documentation, or operating personnel), databases, advice, and access to such services, facilities, or data- bases by "
"any technological means, if:  "
"(A) The data to be processed, stored or furnished are financial, banking or economic; "
and 
(B) The hardware  provided in connection therewith is offered only in conjunction with 
"software designed and marketed for the processing, storage and transmission of "
"financial, banking, or economic data, and where the general purpose hardware does not "
constitute more than 30 percent of the cost of any packaged offering.
29 
The point of the foregoing is to illustrate that the simple proposed definition in the NPRM of “ba nk 
"service provider” has insufficient clarity as to the intended scope of the regulatio n, without reference  "
"first to contractual service providers subject to examination under the BSCA , and second to permissible "
nonbanking activities under the Bank Holding Company Act –  areas of detail known only to regulatory 
specialists.  
The policy direction underlying the NP RM s uggests that the regulators should wish to more clearly 
provide notice of the application to technology service providers (TSPs) to banks.   The NPRM preamble 
description of the second aspect of the proposal requiring a bank service provider to notify banking organiz ations of a computer security incident states:  “ As technological developments  have increased in 
"pace, banks have  become increasingly reliant on bank  service providers to provide essential  technology -"
related products and  services. ”

"notices, and similar items, or any other clerical, bookkeeping, accounting, statistical, or similar functions "
performed for a bank.

 they “do not have data on the number of bank service providers that would be affected by this  
requirement.”31 They provide an estimate through reference to the North American Industry 
"Classification  System (NAICS) industry code 5415, “Computer System Design and Related Services.”  "
"Separate from the number of affected parties, th is reference provides further indication of a relevant "
"target group for the regulation, as distinct from the myriad other services which fall under the cascade "
of the BSCA reference.  
The FFIEC TSP Booklet includes the identification and selection of TSPs warranting interagency 
supervision and the development of a risk -based supervisory strategy for each of these entities. Th at 
"approach provides for examination coverage of selected TSPs, including the non -exclusive list of core "
"application processors, electronic funds transfer switches, Internet banking providers, item processors, "
"managed security servicers, and data storage servicers.32 "
NPRM request for comment item 10 regarding the definition of “bank service provider” also requests 
"comment on which bank service providers, or which services should be subject to the notification "
requirements.  We suggest that as an administrative matter the regulation text for the notification 
"requirement on bank service provider should be drafted broadly, but the Federal Banking Agencies "
should provide guidance  (which can be amended or updated from time to time)  with a non -exclusive 
list of categories of bank service provider subject to the regulation .  This should include in one place 
each of the classes of service providers mentioned  in the foregoing sources referenced in  this comment 
letter  which reflect past regulatory determinations of the Federal Banking Agencies of relevance to the 
"purposes of the proposed rule.   Without such transparency , however, it would not be rational to expect "
that such bank service providers had received effective notice of the intend ed application of the new 
"proposed rule, which would undermine its policy effectiveness.  "
"Comment Item 11. Notification of all, or only affected, banking organizations  "
We believe that bank service providers should err on the side of cautious in notifying an y banking 
"organizations that might  be affected by an incident.  In this context, it must be understood, that the "
bank service provider would not necessarily be expected “immediately” to have a full understanding of 
"the impact of the incident.  That being s aid, the notification requirement in the NPRM should not "
require the bank service provider to notify entities of incidents which the bank service provider 
"reasonably believes are limited to unrelated entities, such as a data access or corruption issue limited to the data of one banking organization.  The exclusion of such limited incidents from the notification "
requirement under the NPRM should not be viewed as preventing a banking organization customer 
from learning generically about the statistical reliab ility of a particular service provided to the banking 
sector.  
Comment Item 13. How best to notify at least two individuals at banking organizations  
We do not believe that all bank service organizations currently have sufficient processes to carry out the 
proposed regulatory requirement for timely notification to their banking organization customers of an 
"incident.  In particular, as described above, an outage impacting the service could also impact the bank "
 
31 86 Fed. Reg. 2304.

" service provider’s normal means of communication w ith the banking organization customer.  Therefore, "
the communications channel planned for meeting such notification requirement should also 
contemplate appropriate business continuity measures or alternative channels.  Regarding the proposal 
"to notify at l east two individuals at affected banking organizations, we propose that the most efficient "
and best option on the side of each of the bank service provider and the banking organization is to agree 
a central point of contact at the banking organization whic h would be accessible by more than one 
person to ensure that notifications to the banking organization are timely received and acted upon.  This 
could best be accomplished by a structured process involving written communications (likely a 
"standardized inci dent message), rather than naming two individuals or involving telephone "
communication.  
"Also, the proposed notification requirement for bank service providers would apply for an incident “for "
"four or more hours.”  This time element, however, appears superfluous, as the notification applies to a "
“computer -security incident” which is proposed to be defined as an occurrence that results in actual or 
"potential harm or constitutes a violation or imminent threat of violation of security policies.  We suggest that, if the Federal Banking Agencies consider alternative definitions of incident, the time element could "
"be one factor that alone would require notification to a banking organization if the service were unavailable more than four hours.  Other material risks , such as potential data loss or compromise, "
should be subject to notification requirements regardless of the time element.  T he NIST framework 
provides other guidance to establishing materiality thresholds for notification.  
Comments with respect to the Pa perwork Reduction Act elements  
We believe and posit : 
"(a) for the reasons stated above, the collections of information are necessary for the proper "
"performance of the agencies’ functions,  and, yes, the information has  practical utility  to the "
Federal Banking Agencies ; 
"(c) + (d) regarding ways to enhance the quality,  utility, and clarity of the information to  be collected;  "
"and ways to minimize the burden of  the information collections on  respondents, including "
through the use  of automate d collection techniques or  other forms of information technology;  
please see the response to comment item 5 above regarding notification to the Federal Banking 
Agencies .
