Re: Computer -Security Incident Notification Requirements for Banking Organizations 
and Their Bank Service Providers  
 
BSA | The Software Alliance (“BSA”) is grateful for the opportunity to provide preliminary 
feedback on the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“NPRM”) regarding potential Computer -
Security Incident Notification Requirements for Banking Organizations and Their Bank ing 
Service Providers .1  BSA is the leading advocate for the global software industry. Our 
members provide services across the financial services industry and thus have deep insight 
into the challenges of securing the industry against the threats that it face s.2 As global 
 
1 See Computer -Security Incident Notification Requirements for Banki ng Organizations and 
"Their Bank Service Providers , 86 Fed. Reg. 22 99 (Jan. 12, 2021 ) (hereinafter “ NPRM ”). "
"2 BSA’s members include: Adobe, Atlassian, Autodesk, Bentley Systems, Box, "
"CNC/Mastercam, DocuSign, IBM, Informatica, MathWorks, Microsoft, Okta, Oracle, PTC, "
"Salesforce, ServiceNow, Siemens Industry Software Inc., Slack, Splunk, Trend Micro, "
"Trimble Soluti ons Corporation, Twilio, and Workday.  Page 2 "
 
"corporations, we also have a shared interest in protecting the integrity of the U.S. financial "
system. BSA therefore applauds the underlying objectives of the NPRM.  
"We recognize the important supervisory interest the Office of the Comptroll er of the Currency, "
"the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Federal Reserve (collectively, the “Agencies”) have in receiving timely notifications about “significant computer -security "
incident (s) that could jeopardize the viability of the operati ons of an individual banking 
"organization, result in customers being unable to access their deposit and other accounts, or "
impact the stability of the financial sector .” We likewise recognize that banking service 
providers play a critical role in enabling their banking customers to meet their regulatory 
obligations.  A properly scoped computer -security incident notification requirement can 
facilitate  the timely sharing of actionable information about ongoing threats  between 
stakeholders and regulators in a manner that enhances collective security interests . Rather 
"than establishing a new compliance “ burden, ” an effective incident notification framework can "
foster partnership between impacted stakeholders and encourage greater proactive 
"cooperation. To accomplish these objectives, the cyber -incident notification requirement "
should assign roles and responsibilities that are both clearly defined and targeted to ensure 
"that the information being shared is actionable. While the NPRM largely hits the mark,  we "
highlight two aspects of the proposed rule that would benefit from clarification.    
 
1. The Definition of “Computer -Security Incident” is Ambiguous and Overbroad  
"Pursuant to the proposed rule, banking service providers will be required to provide "
notification to their banking customers upon experiencing a “computer -security incident that it 
"believes in good faith could disrupt, degrade, or impair services …for four or more hours. ” The "
term “computer -security incident” is defined as  an “occurrence” that either “ (i) results in actual 
"or potential harm to the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an information system or the "
"information that the system processes, stores, or transmits ” or “(ii) constitutes a violation or "
"imminent threat of violation of security policies, security procedures, or acceptable use "
policies. ”  
We recommend a narrowing of the “computer -security incident” definition so that it focuses 
only on circumstances where there is evidence of actual harm. The reference to “potential 
harm” – particularly  in combination with the requirement to provide notification  for incidents 
that “ could ” result in service d isruption – renders the rule highly  ambiguous . A requirement to 
provide notification in circumstances where there is no evidence of an actual harm or service 
disruption is also far too broad. One of the key  security  benefits of modern cloud service 
providers is their ability to identify and block anoma lous cyber activity using automated 
"processes. Depending on the nature of the service,  a cloud provider  may detect and analyze "
over 8 trillion threat signals on behalf of their customers every day.3 Requiring service 
providers to notify all of their customers each time they identify  a threat with the potential to 
"cause harm would quickly exhaust resources, not only of the service providers, but of the ir "
 
"3 See, e.g., New data from Microsoft shows how the pandemic is accelerating the digital "
transformation of cyber -security  (August 2020)  available at 
https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/08/19/microsoft -shows -pandemic -accelerating-
transformation- cyber -security/ .   Page 3 
 
"banking customers that will have to receive, analyze, and address the notifications from all "
their applicable service provider s.  
"In addition to removing the “potential harm”  reference in the first prong of the definition,  we "
recommend the elimination of the second prong of the definition in its entirety. Tying the 
"notification obligation to the “violat ion or imminent threat of violation of security policies, "
"security procedures, or acceptable use policies”  implicates the same concerns noted above. "
A requirement that is triggered by the potential violation of a service provider’s internal 
"policies , even when there is no evidence of actual harm, will necessitate the sending of "
notices about events that are  far removed from the type of cyber incident that this NPRM is 
intended to address. Because  the definition extends to “acceptable use policies” that may be 
"entirely unrelated to security, service providers may feel compelled to notify their financial "
services customers about events that do not warrant a security response from the financial 
"institution, increasing effort from the customer’s response team an d directing security and "
reporting resources away from more critical activities.  
• Recommendation: 
(1) Computer -security incident is an occurrence that — 
"(i) Results in actual or potential  harm to the confidentiality, integrity, "
or availability of an information system or the information that the 
"system processes, stores, or transmits; or  "
(ii) Constitutes a violation or imminent threat of violation of security 
"policies, security procedures,  or acceptable use policies.  "
 
2. The “Immediate” Notification Requirement f or Banking Service Providers May 
Undermine  the Objective s of the Proposed Rule  
The NPRM requires a service provider to notify its banking customers “immediately” after 
experiencing a computer -security incident that the service provider “believes in good faith 
"could disrupt, degrade, or impair services …for four or more hours .” The NPRM suggests  that "
an “immediate” notification requirement is reasonable “ because the notice would not need to 
"include an assessment of the incident .” Be that as it may, the purpose of the rule is to ensure "
that banking organizations receive notification when their service provider has a “good faith” 
"belief that a cyber -security incident may “ disrupt, degrade, or impair ” services for more than "
four hours. It is unclear how the immediate notification requirement – which is pegged to the 
occurrence of the underlying computer -security incident –  would allow for the service provider 
to undertake the type of investigation that would be necessary to make “good faith” 
determination about the severity of the event and the likelihood it may give rise to a service 
disruption.  
"Moreover, an immediate notification requirement is ultimately inconsistent with the goals of "
"the NPRM, which seeks to  “enable a banking organization to promptly respond to an incident, "
"determine whether it must notify its primary federal regulator that a notification incident has occurred, and take other appropriate measures related to the incident .” Rather than helping "
"banking organizations identify material  threats and develop informed responses, a n "
immediate notification requirement would result in banks  being inundated with a high volume 
"of notifications that would be devoid of any meaningful content, actionable intelligence, or "
"necessary context.  In this regard, t he immediate notification requirement could have the Page 4 "
 
unintended effect of undermining a bank’s  security efforts by forcing it to devote resources t o 
analyzing and triaging low -information notices relating to cyber incidents that ultimately have 
no impact on the stability or availability of the third-party  services on which they rely.  
• Recommendation: 
§ 53.4 Bank service provider notification.  
A bank service provider is required to notify at least two individuals at each 
affected banking organization customer immediately after the bank service 
provider experiences  UPON CONCLUDING IN GOOD FAITH THAT a 
"computer - security incident that it believes in good faith  could disrupt, "
"degrade, or impair services provided subject to the Bank Service Company "
Act (12 U.S.C. 1861– 1867) for four or more hours.
