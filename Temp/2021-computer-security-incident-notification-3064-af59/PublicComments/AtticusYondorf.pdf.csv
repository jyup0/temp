Re: Proposed rule titled: Computer -Security Incident Notification Requirements for Banking 
Organizations and Their Bank Service Providers. Docket ID OCC –2020 –0038 ; Docket No. R –
"1736 , published at 86 Fed. Reg. 2299 (Jan .12, 2021).  "
 
 
"I respectfully submit the following comments to th e Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, "
"the Federal Reserve System, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  regarding the "
proposed rule titled “ Computer -Security Incident Notificatio n Requirements for Banking 
Organizations and Their Bank Service Provider s.” The proposed rule would be codified at  12 
"CFR Part 53, 225, and 304.  "
 
"These comments are submitted by Atticus Yondorf, a law student interested in administrative "
law and banking regulations. I submit these comments in my individual capacity and not on 
behalf of any organization.  
 
"I. I write in support the proposed rule.  First, notification s under the current regulatory "
scheme are  inadequate . The  potential threats posed by contemporary hackers and system 
failures —such as  those caused by  natural catastrophes –either go unmonitored or are brought to 
the attention of appropriate a gencies too late. The proposed  rule address es the current lack o f 
"targeted notification by creating a separate  notification process , an important step toward "
properly addressing the current threats .  
 
"Second,  the notification requirements are unlikely to  be overly burdensome for banking "
institutions . The cost of complian ce would be less onerous than th ose currently incurred f or 
"Suspicious activity report s (SRAs ). Furthermore,  this cost is relatively small in compar ison to the  "
benefits of increased capacity for appropriate agencies  to view defects in the banking system 
"which would inevitably be identified through  the rule’s  targeted notification process.  Third, the notification requirements would, after a sufficient time, provide a substantial amount "
of data to agencies from which they will be able to pinpoint where and how the current banking 
"system is vulnerable to cyber hack s, among other covered acts. The notification requirement in "
"other words, could provide a st rong impetus for more regulation where if and when it  is needed.  "
 
"I do have two concerns about the proposed rule, however.  "
 
II. My first concern  is also a response to the  first and tenth question  posed in the notice . 
"Either the definition of what constitut es an incident is too narrow, or the definition of bank "
"service provider, or more broadly the regulated parties , is too narrow, if this rule is to effect the "
result it intends.   
 
"Currently, the proposed rule defines a computer -security incident as an occurrence that (i) results "
"in actual or potential harm to the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an information "
"system or the information the system processes, stores, or transmits; or (ii) constitutes a violation "
"or imminent threat of violati on of security policies, security procedures, or acceptable use "
policies.  This definition  does not appear to include  hacks /significant catastrophic events that 
"infiltrate/impact third-party ’s information system s that collect banking related information, fo r "
"example, password manager s, browsers, and search engines.  "
 
Two solutions to the problem are eviden t. Either expand  the definition of a computer -security 
incident so as to include hacks/catastrophic events that impact third parties  with information 
system s likely to have stored information or  include third -parties in the definition of a bank 
services provider explicitly.  
 
"III. My second concern with respect to the proposed rule is that, while it may bring security "
"and stability issues to the attention of t he appropriate agencies, it does not tackle the egregious "
need for solutions at the regulatory level to the recent uptick in hacking . Security breaches are a 
"serious and often unaddressed problem across the banking industry. As such, I recommend that "
"the p roposed rule, if passed, be followed by substantial review of the causes of incidents "
"subsequently reported, as well as development of a plan of action to reduce incidents through "
regulation/industry cooperation.  
 
"IV. In conclusion, I wholeheartedly suppor t the proposed rule. However, I hope that in "
"response to the two concerns I have raised, the rule is modified so as to (1) address third part y "
"hacks, and (2) is followed by regulatory action utilizing the information provided by the "
notifications stemming from the rule.  
 
Thank you in advance for your consideration of this comment.  
 
 
"Respectfully submitted,  "
 
Atticus Yondorf
