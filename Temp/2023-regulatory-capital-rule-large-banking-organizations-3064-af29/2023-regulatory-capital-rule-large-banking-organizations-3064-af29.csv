If a banking organization is unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the primary Federal supervisor a comprehensive understanding of the features of an equity exposure that would materially affect the performance of the exposure, the proposal would require the banking organization to assign a risk weight of 1,250 percent to the equity exposure to the investment firm.  "
"64079 Federal Register / Vol. 88, No. 179 / Monday, September 18, 2023 / Proposed Rules  165As externally licensed auditors typically  express their opinions on investment funds’  accounts rather than on the accuracy of the data used for the purposes of applying the full look-  through approach, an external audit would not be  required. 166While not done explicitly, the full look-  through approach under the current capital rule does capture the leverage of an investment fund."

The proposed revisions to the definition of covered positions under subpart F of the capital rule could alter the scope of financial instruments deemed to be in the trading account under the Volcker Rule, but only to the extent that a market risk covered position is also a trading position and the position is not otherwise excluded from the Volcker rule definition of trading account."
