"Dear FDIC, "
I am
 writing to you as a small business owner to urge  you to oppose the proposed rule change that would 
increase capital requirements for banks. These proposed ch anges could potentially affect my ability to secure 
loans and lines of credit that are n ecessary for keeping my business afloat. The impact of this new proposal on 
"banks would ultimately trickle down to small businesses li ke mine, as they may enact more stringent lending "
"practices and limited access to credit, which is already the greatest barrier for wome n-owned businesses. Banks’ "
"requirement to retain more capital on-h and to prevent future losses will le ad to increased costs for borrowers, "
and interest rate hikes will similarl y create undue burdens on small businesses that need the financial assistance 
"to thrive. This proposal is seemingly a solutio n without a problem. Our banks are well-capitalized, with higher capital "
"requirements than European banks, and as stated by Federa l Reserve Chair Jay Powell, “critically very strong,”. "
The COVID-19 pandemic serves as an exam ple of how prepared our banks are. 
"The Biden administration continues to work to reinfo rce assistance for small businesses, while the Federal "
Reserve has worked for the past year to combat inflation. Adopting this proposal  could put a stop to any 
"improvements that we have seen. That’s why I strongly urge you to reject the proposed capital requirements, and pr ioritize small businesses’ "
"financial stability. Small businesses provide vital growth to the Unite d States’ economy, as they employ "
"hundreds of thousands of people, contribute immensely to economic growth, a nd encourage innovation—we "
cannot allow these rules to undermine the significant contributions that I and other small business owners 
"provide for the economy.  Respectfully, "
"Lisa Nutt, MBA "
