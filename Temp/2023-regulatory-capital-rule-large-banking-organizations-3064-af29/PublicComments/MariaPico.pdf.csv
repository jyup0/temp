"Dear FDIC,"
Raising capital requirements on banks is a significant policy change that can have extensive
"consequences for small businesses like mine, and I'm concerned about the potential negativeimpact it may have on our ability to thrive and grow."
"When banks are required to hold more capital, they often become more cautious about their"
"lending practices. This can lead to a decrease in the amount of credit available to smallbusinesses. As a result, it becomes more challenging for entrepreneurs like me to access thefunds needed to expand, invest in new equipment, or hire additional employees."
"Additionally, when faced with higher capital requirements, banks may pass on the additional"
"costs to borrowers, including small businesses. This means that interest rates on loans andcredit lines could go up. For small businesses that already operate on tight budgets, higherborrowing costs can be a significant burden and deter their ability to compete and innovate."
While raising capital requirements on banks is often implemented with the intention of
"increasing financial stability and reducing the risk of banking crises, it's essential to considerthe potential effect "
 
on small businesses and local communities. We need to strike a balance
"between prudent regulation and ensuring that small businesses, especially those owned byminority entrepreneurs, have the resources they need to thrive and drive economic prosperity.Thatâ€™s why I urge you to reconsider this proposal."
