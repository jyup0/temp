To W
hom It May Concern: 
I am proud to have represented the great Town of Leesburg and Loudoun County for decades as a member of 
"the Town Council. We have been able to accomplish in credible economic goals toge ther, making it easier and "
"more affordable for families to live in our incredible to wn. To that end, I am worried  that things could become "
more expensive and costly for families under the newly in troduced rule to raise capital requirements for banks. 
The impact of this rule’s economic consequences can be  seen when it comes to th e housing market. Under this 
"regulation, banks would look to make it harder and costly for first time homebuyers to  obtain a mortgage. At the "
"same time, banks would also raise th eir loan requirements. This means that applicants who don’t have enough "
"saved for a 20% down payment could see their mortgage ap plication rejected, as banks  would consider them a "
risky borrower. It would lock out countless families from a housing mark et that is becoming increasingly 
unaffordable. 
We would also see many family businesses in Northern  Virginia struggle to keep  their doors open. They are 
"reliant on banks to help provide the nece ssary financial support to pay for crit ical necessities, such as payroll for "
"employees or rent for their storef ront. This has sounded the alarm for small businesses, who are already "
constrained in their ability to obtain consistent access to capital due to hi gh interest rates that may not come 
down for years. 
It is clear as day that we  cannot allow this rule to raise capital requ irements to be completed. It would have 
devastating economic consequences on our housing market and small business communities. To help make sure 
"that Leesburg continues to be an affordable and welcom ing place to live, you must vote against this regulation. "
