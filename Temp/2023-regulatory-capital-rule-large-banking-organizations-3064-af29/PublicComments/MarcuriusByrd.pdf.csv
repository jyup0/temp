I write to express m
y strong opposition to the proposal that seeks to increase cap ital requirements for banks. 
"While I understand the importance of  maintaining financial stability, I believe that this proposal, if "
"implemented, could have a detrimental impact on clean energy initiatives and the broader goals "
of environmental sustainability. 
"As a Richland County resident, I am acutely aware of the critical need to transition towards cleaner and more "
"sustainable energy sources. Climate change  is an existential threat that de mands urgent action, and the financial "
"sector plays a pivotal role in supporting this transiti on. In our region alone, we have already seen over $80 "
million dedicated to clean energy initiatives through the launching of the Richland County Solar Project back in 
"2019. Through this and several other projects, "
"policies, and efforts, we have worked hard to prom ote clean energy to create a more sustainable future. "
This progress may now be limited by the proposed increase s on capital requirements. De velopers in charge of 
"clean energy initiatives often require  significant upfront investments, whic h they can obtain through banks via "
"loans. However, this regulation would make banks less lik ely to provide loans to proj ects they deem too risky, "
"directly limiting their ability to provid e loans to these very same groups. As  a result, our clean energy projects "
here in Richland County and across the country may find themselves 
in limbo due to increased difficulties in obtaining the financing they need. 
"Moreover, our country’s leading economic minds have already stated that any such capital "
requirement increases are not necessary. Treasury Secretar y Janet Yellen has previously confirmed that “banks 
have adequate capital” and are well equipped to with stand choppy economic times. 
"The Biden-Harris administration has made clean energy in vestments a top priority, as  seen through key pieces "
of legislation such as the Infrastructure Investment a nd Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. To fully take 
"advantage of this moment for historic change, we need to aid developers with thes e projects by ensuring they "
"have access to the financial services they need. By reje cting any increase in bank capital requirements, we can "
ensure that this progress is not unnecessarily impeded.
