My two decades of experience in policymaking have helped me understand that adequate access to 
credit is fundamental for economic vitality and pers onal financial advancement. I strongly oppose the 
suggested increase in capital requirements on banks because it jeopardizes this fundamental acces
s 
and limits opportunities for upward mobility.  
The financial and regulatory landscape has undergone substantial transformation over the past 15 
"years. Global regulatory reforms have signific antly improved banking resilience, risk management, "
"and market stability. In the U.S., banks have consi derably elevated their capitalization levels and "
enhanced risk management practices in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act. With regular stress 
"testing, robust risk governance, and updated re solution plans, the industry has demonstrated "
"resilienceâ€“most notably duri ng the COVID-19 pandemic. Given th ese advancements, the current "
efforts to enforce additional regulations are unnece ssary and could impede economic growth without 
effectively addressing any underlying problems.  
Moving forward with these rule changes would directly  affect everyday Americans. For those looking 
"to make significant purchases like cars or homes, the proposal could make borrowing more "
"expensive and limit access to credit. Prospective homebuyers, especially thos e with limited resources "
"for down payments, may encounter difficulties securi ng a mortgage. Small businesses, the backbone "
"of local economies, also depend on loans to run t heir operations and contribu te to growth. Without "
"reliable access to credit, these businesses may bec ome unable to hire new employees and expand. "
"As borrowing becomes more challenging, it could hi nder the growth and stability of various industries.  "
"Given the harm that raising capital requirem ents could cause on our economy, I urge you to "
reconsider this proposal.
