The Coalition for Derivatives End -Users (the “Coalition”) is pleased to respond to the request s for 
comments by :  
"1. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency , the Board of Governors of the Federal "
Reserve System  (the “Federal Reserve”) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
"(collectively, the “ Federal Banking Agencies ”) in connection with the notice of proposed "
rulemaking titled “Large  Banking Organizations and Banking Organizations with 
Significant Trading Activity ” (the “Basel III Endgame Proposal”) ; and

“Regulatory Capital Rule: Risk-Based Capital Surcharges for Global Systemically 
Important Bank Holding Companies; System Risk Report (FR Y -15)” (the “GSIB

"1  88 Fed. Reg. 64028 (Sept. 18, 2023)  (Basel III Endgame Proposal); 88 Fed. Reg. 60385 (Sept. 1, 2023) (GSIB "
"Surcharge Proposal).  To begin , the Coalition is extremely concerned with several aspects of the Proposal s, which fail to "
consider the significant impacts on derivatives end -users and the broader U.S. economy . We raised 
"concerns i n a letter dated July 5, 2023  and addressed to the Federal Banking Agencies .2 We hoped "
"that, by sharing our thoughts prior to release of the Basel III Endgame Proposal , any proposal "
"would avoid the principal concerns we raised. Unfortunately, that did not happen. Today, then, we "
share comments on behalf of the end -user community with the goal of ensuring that end -users 
continue to be able to efficiently and effectively manage their business risks  and are not subjected 
to undue burdens  in so doing . 
I. Background  
The Coalition represents hundreds  of end-user companies across the U.S. that employ derivatives 
primarily to manage the commercial risks  they face in connection with their day-to-day businesses . 
Our message is straightforward: financial regulatory reform measures should promote economic 
"stability , transparency and resiliency without imposing undue burdens on derivatives end -users  "
and the broader U.S. economy . Imposing unnecessary regulation directly on end -users  or 
"indirectly, through their counterparties  as these Proposal s do, will create more economic "
"instability, restrict job growth, decrease productive investment and hamper U.S. competit iveness "
in the global economy —and may result in less hedging by end -users.  
The use of derivatives to hedge commercial risk benefits the global economy by allowing a range 
of businesses —from manufacturing to healthcare to agriculture to energy to renewable power to 
technology —to improve their planning and forecasting and offer more stable prices to consumers 
and more stable contribution s to economic growth. Large banking organizations that would be 
subject to the Proposal s serve as critical counterparties to commercial end-users for their 
"derivatives transactions. They also serve as capital markets intermediaries, sources of stable credit, "
"underwriters of corporate debt and equity securities , and liquidity providers, and play other critical "
finan cial intermediary roles. The Proposal s would significantly increase capital requirements for 
the large st U.S. banks that provide the bulk of derivatives -related products and services to 
corporations  of all sizes and across the economy . Corporations use derivative s products  to hedge 
"and mitigate commercial risks associated with their businesses, including interest rate risk, foreign "
currency risk and commodities risks . Coalition member s’ ability to hedge and mitigate such 
"commercial risks is crucial to their business operations and the broader U.S. economy . Yet, the "
availability and cost of and competition for the delivery of such products would be materially 
adversely affected in the wake of changes implemented under the Proposal s. 
The Coalition supports the Federal Banking Agencies’ efforts to promote safety and soundness 
"and resolvability and bolster financial stability. However, the Coalition has serious concerns with "
several major aspects of the Proposal s. Commercial end -users face material  increas es in hedging 
"costs, disincentiviz ing prudent risk -management by corporations, and ultimately increas ing risk "
"and reduc ing investment in our economy . In that concern , we echo statements made by Federal "
Reserve Chair Powell who voiced concerns that “… raising capital requirements also increases the 
"cost of, and reduces access to, credit. And the proposed very large increase in risk -weighted assets "
for market risk overall requires us to assess the risk that large U.S. banks could reduce their 
 
"2  A copy of the Coalition’s letter, dated July 5, 2023, is attached hereto. The Coalition requests that the letter "
"be incorporate d into the record of the Federal Banking Agencies’ review and consideration of the Proposal s. activities in this area, threatening a decline in liquidity in critical markets and a movement of some "
of these activities into the shadow banking sector.”3 Fellow Board Member Governor Bowman 
conveyed similar concerns when she urged the Federal Banking A gencies to “ carefully weigh the 
"trade -offs of increased safety from higher capital levels, and the costs to banks, consumers, "
"businesses, and the broader economy ” and “ factor in the broader regulatory landscape, and how "
"changes to capital regulations may complement, overlap, or conflict with other regulatory "
requirements. ”4 
"In the current economic environment , the Coalition has serious concerns that increased transaction "
costs associated with prudent risk -management hedging practices by derivatives end -users will 
result in two  material impacts: (i) even further increased costs will flow through to consumers for 
"their day -to-day goods, services and necessities; and (ii) reduced hedging by end -users, which will "
lead to greater price volatility.  These results would be bad for consumers and bad for economic 
stability . 
"Specifically , the Coalition is concerned with the following aspects of the Proposal s: "
Proposal of Amendments Applicable to Large Banking Organizations and to Banking 
Organizations with Significant Trading Activity  
"1. Credit Valuation Adjustment (“CVA”) : With respect to CVA risk, the Basel III "
Endgame Proposal would require all large banking organizations (instead of Category I 
and II banking organizations under the current capital rules) to raise additional capital for 
CVA on derivatives  transactions with all counterparties. This is completely additive and 
overlaps with capital that is already held by large U.S. banking organizations as a result of 
CVA’s inclusion in the Global Market Shock (“GMS”) component of the Fede ral 
"Reserve’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”). Further, the Basel III "
"Endgame Proposal would not  include a tailored approach to commercial end -users , "
"resulting in the inclusion of derivatives transactions with corporates, pension funds and "
"certain other counterparties  in the calculation of CVA risk capital , regardless of their status "
"as counterparties who use derivatives to reduce inherent risk in their business, rather than "
to speculate . These derivatives transactions tend to be long -term and directional and thus 
"attract higher CVA risk capital, which would translate into significantly higher costs and "
"reduced availability of these products, leading t o significantly adverse outcomes for those "
end-users.  
a. Requested Revision: Uncleared d erivatives transactions with commercial end -users 
and their associated hedges should be exempt from CVA -risk-capital requirements 
"(i) because of the undue burden imposed on commercial end -users, (ii) because "

"H. Powell  (July 27, 2023), available at : https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/powell -"
statement -20230727.pdf .  
"4    Michelle W. Bowman , Statement by Federal Reserve Governor Michelle W. Bowman At the Board Meeting "
considering proposed rules to implement the Basel III endgame agreement for large banks and adjustments 
"to the surcharge for U.S. global systemically important banks  (July 27, 2023), available at : "
https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/bowman -statement -20230727.pdf . increased CVA -risk-capital requirements would be in contravention of public 
policy objectives designed to support the ability of commercial end -users to engage 
"in derivative transactions for risk -management purposes, and (iii) to align U.S. "
capital require ments with those implemented by other jurisdictions . Client  cleared 
derivatives should be exempt from CVA -risk-capital requirements  because there is 
no CVA risk to large banks in client clearing.  
2. Fundamental Review of the Trading Book : The Coalition has significant concerns with 
the calibration of the market risk component of the Basel III Endgame Proposal – known 
"as the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (“FRTB”) , principally the lack of "
"diversification and hedge recognition, as well as concerns that—similar to CVA —FRTB "
"is duplicative of and redundant with aspects of the GMS component of CCAR , which is "
designed to capture risks similar to those captured by FRTB.  
a. Requested Revision: The Coalition urges the Federal Banking Agencies to make 
substantive changes to FRTB to avoid the double counting of market risks  under 
"the Basel III Endgame Proposal  and the GMS component of CCAR or, failing that, "
to delay the implementation of FRTB until a holistic review has been performed 
across FRTB and the GMS component of CCAR . In the absence of such substantive 
"changes or a delay  in its implementation , the Coalition urges that derivatives with "
commercial end -users and their associated hedges should be exempt from FRTB’s 
non-modellable risk factor (“NMRF”) requirements  to avoid undue burden on 
derivatives end -users . 
3. Determination of “Investment Grade” for Unlisted Corporate Exposures (the “Public 
Listing Requirement”) : The Basel III Endgame Proposal would provide a preferential 
65% risk weight for investment grade corporate exposures based on a large banking 
organization’s internal assessment of creditworthiness. The Basel III Endgame Proposal 
"would require, however, that the preferential 65% risk weight can only be applied if the "
counterparty or its parent has outstanding shares that are publicly traded on a national 
securities exchange or foreign equivalent —a requirements that in and of itself is not a sole 
leading indicator of creditworthiness or default risk . 
a. Requested Revision: The Coalition urges the Federal Banking Agencies to remove 
the Public Listing Requirement because it is likely to negatively affect highly 
"creditworthy corporations, agriculture and food processing entities, energy "
"producers, corporate pensions and mutual funds , among others,  that are not publicly "
"listed, with no corresponding benefit to large banking organizations, and "
diverges —materially —from the capital requirements implemented by the EU and 
UK. 
Proposal to Revise the Calculation of the GSIB Risk -Based Capital Surcharge  
The GSIB Surcharge Proposal will significantly increase capital requirements for the over -the-
counter ( “OTC ”) client clearing activities of the U.S. GSIBs. Since the inception of the GSIB 
"surcharge in the U.S., OTC derivatives clearing under the agency model have been excluded from "
the GSIB surcharge’s complexity and interconnectedness indicators . The GSIB Surcharge Proposal would add OTC derivatives clearing under the agency model to the complexity and 
interconnectedness indicators of the GSIB surcharge.   
Raising capital requirements for OTC derivatives clearing would introduce barriers for end -users 
"in accessing cleared OTC derivatives services, by increasing costs for end -users and decreasing "
capacity of clearing by the U.S. GSIBs.  These Proposals run counter to G20 and Dodd -Frank Act 
"reforms, which encouraged central clearing of derivatives , and would increase systemic risk by "
"reducing the capacity of prudentially regulated banks from providing client clearing.5 In addition, "
many OTC derivatives traded by Coalition members are mandated for clearing and the increase in 
costs may mean end -users are unable to hedge those mandated products.  
a. Requested Revision: The Coalition urges  the Federal Reserve not to add OTC 
derivatives clearing under the agency model to the complexity and 
interconnectedness indicators of the GSIB surcharge.  It should be noted that 
"international regulators, including the UK and EU, continue to view that client "
clearing under the agency model does not add to the c omplexity indicator.  
Although we provide specific recommendations to improve the framework for securities 
"derivatives, market risk and corporate exposures, we want to highlight that the Proposals’ "
structural deficiencies and lack of a publicly available impact analysis would p revent discrete or 
"targeted changes alone from resulting in an appropriately calibrated capital framework, and that a "
more holistic approach is necessary in order to avoid disruptions to our members’ ability to access 
critical services. We therefore urge t he Federal Banking Agencies to re -propose the Basel III 
Endgame Proposal and the Federal Reserve to re -propose the GSIB Surcharge Proposal in a 
manner that that better substantiates the benefits of these changes and allows the public to 
understand the Federal Banking Agencies’ impact analysis  of these Proposals.  
II.  The Proposal s’ Impacts on  Hedging  
"As noted above, c orporations use derivatives to efficiently manage their price risks,  allowing those "
companies to more consistently forecast their earnings and focus on growing their core businesses 
"to the benefit of the U.S. economy . Utilities, airlines  and manufacturers use commodity derivatives "
 
"5    A November 19, 2018 Financial Stability Board (“FSB”) titled “ Incentives to centrally cleared over -the-"
counter (OTC) derivatives: A post -implementation evaluation of the effects of the G20 financial regulatory 
"reforms – final report ”, available at : https://www.bis.org/publ/othp29.pdf , contained the following findings:  "
• “OTC derivatives contracts have in general become more standardised and more likely to be 
"centrally cleared. As a result, complexity has declined in these markets, and consequently the "
likelihood this activity is a source of contagion following bank failur e has reduced. These are 
intended consequences which reduce systemic risk. An assessment whether the GSIB methodology 
provides appropriate incentives for central clearing and whether it provides any unwarranted 
"disincentives for banks to provide client clearing services may be merited .” (FSB report, at 70 "
(emphasis supplied)).  
• “The equivalent treatment of the same notional whether centrally cleared or uncleared in the 
complexity measure was seen as failing to recognise the benefits of central clearing in reducing 
"complexity in the financial system. Trade standardisation, robust margining practices and other "
"aspects of CCP financial resources, and predictable default management and porting processes are "
"all viewed as significant here.”  (FSB report, at 69).  to hedge against volatility in input costs ; farmers and the agricultural industry use commodity "
derivatives to lock in prices  so they can confidently grow ; corporations with international 
operations must hedge the risk of currency fluctuations arising from operating on a global stage ; 
renewable power producers use electricity derivatives to insulate their earnings from future swings 
"in commodities markets, and raise construction funding; corporations that have issued debt hedge "
against changes in interest r ates; and c orporate pensions use derivatives to ensure a safe stream of 
income for American retirees . The benefits of these risk mitigation transactions feed through to 
"the American public through reduced costs, greater investment in innovation and job creation, and "
broader market discipline and economic and financial stability.  
"To help facilitate the efficient access to the derivatives hedging market, Congress deliberately "
exempted end -users that are hedging business risks from having to post margin on uncleared 
derivatives transactions and from having to clear derivatives transactions.6 In alignment with those 
policy objectives designed to support the ability of commercial end -users to engage in derivative 
transactions for risk -management purposes  and in recognition of the same concerns raised in this 
"letter , the Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (“SA -CCR”) rule finalized by the "
Federal Banking Agencies in 2020 remove d the alpha factor of 1.4 from the exposure amount 
"calculation for derivative contracts with commercial end -user counterparties , thus mitigating some "
of the impacts of higher capital  requirements that otherwise would have result ed from the SA -
CCR.7 
The significant increase in CVA -risk-capital  requirement s in the Basel III Endgame Proposal 
would effectively undo the benefits afforded to derivatives end-users by the lower multiplier under 
"the final SA -CCR rule  by adding an additional and entirely new driver of capital, and would be in "
contravention of public policy objectives specifically designed to support the ability of commercial 
end-users to engage in derivative s transactions for risk -management purposes . Such increases 
would  have wide -ranging impacts beyond large bank ing organizations  subject to the Proposal s and 
beyond even their immediate counterparties .8 
 
 
"6    See, e.g., The Commodity Exchange Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended by sections "
"731 and 764, respectively, of the Dodd -Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act  (the “Dodd -"
"Frank Act”) , require the agencies to, in establishing capital and margin requirements for non -cleared swaps, "
"provide an exemption for certain types of counterparties ( e.g., counterparties that are not financial entities "
and are using swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risks) from the mandatory clearing requirement. See 7 
U.S.C. § 6s(e)(3)(C); 15 U.S.C. § 78o -10(e)(3)(C); see also  12 CFR Part 45 (OCC); 12 CFR Part 237 (Federal 
Reserve); and 12 CFR Part 349 (FDIC) (swap margin rule); Business Risk Mitigation Price Stabilization Act 
"of 2015. “Forcing businesses to post margin not only ties up capital, but also makes it more expensive  for "
firms to utilize the risk management tools that they need to protect their businesses from uncertainty. Today’s 
bill clarifies in statute that Congress meant what it said when it exempted end users from margin and clearing 
"requirements. Specifically, it ensures that those businesses which are exempt from clearing their hedges are "
"also exempt from margining those hedges.” 114th Congr. Rec. H -67-68 (Jan. 7, 2015) (state of Rep. Mike "
Conaway).  
"7    “Standardized Approach for Calculating the Exposure Amount of Derivative Contracts” 85 Fed. Reg. 4362, "
"at 4365 (Jan. 24, 2020).  "
"8    See, supra , note 6. The costs of the Proposal s are clear; the Federal Banking Agencies note that the aggregate capital "
levels are expected to increase by nearly 20% across banks that provide these services and 70% 
for market risk specifically.9 But even these significant capital increases do not hit all business 
sectors proportionately. Projected increases in capital for derivatives activities in particular are 
"materially higher than these blended totals, and the impact will be felt disproportionately in the "
derivatives markets.  
The Coalition respectfully submits that the benefits  to the broader markets are substantially less 
"clear . In fact, among the more than 1,000 pages of the Proposal s, there is very little that describes "
overall benefits of the Proposal s aside from citing selected academic research on the costs of the 
"financial crisis; further, there is virtually no discussion or data that provides estimates of the costs "
and benefits to derivatives end -users .  
Significantly i ncreased costs of capital would force large bank ing organizations  to pass on those 
higher capital  costs  to end -users and their customers or require derivatives end -users to post margin 
on those derivatives transactions —in either case undermining Congressional and Federal Banking 
Agency exemptions specifically designed to mitigate those risks  in furtherance of sound public 
"policy . Alternatively, the resulting higher costs of capital may require large banks to simply "
"withdraw from some capital markets activities altogether , which  would either force corporations "
"to stop utilizing risk -reducing derivatives entirely, or would drive derivatives activity into the "
"unregulated, opaque shadow banking system.  Increased transaction costs may also force "
"corporations to hedge less or not to hedge their derivatives transactions altogether. This , of course, "
"would result in increased systemic risk to the financial markets  more broadly , particularly during "
"times of stress . Material increases in cost, coupled with the potential decrease in large bank "
"participation in these markets, would hinder end -users’ abilities to effectively hedge and reduce "
"business risks. This, in turn, would discourage capital investmen t, econom ic growth and job "
creation  and reduce the resiliency and innovation of U.S. companies who may reinvest less in 
"growth to offset those increased costs.  Finally, increased transaction and hedging costs will "
undoubtedly flow through to consumers who are already experiencing dramatic increases in the 
costs of their day -to-day expenses for goods and services.  
III.  CVA  
"Under the Basel III Endgame Proposal, CVA capital must be  calculated for all counterparties with "
"CVA -covered positions with no exemptions,  resulting in the inclusion of derivatives transactions "
"with corporates, pension funds and certain  other counterparties  in large banking organizations’ "
"CVA -risk-capital requirements . For derivatives transactions with commercial end -users, CVA will "
be entirely additive to existing capital requirement held by large banking organizations on 
"derivative s transactions , with no corresponding benefit to those banking organizations or the "
broader financial system generally as described below . 
• The Coalition urges the Federal Banking Agencies to exempt derivatives transactions 
"with corporates, pension funds, insurance companies and other commercial end -users "
(and their associated hedges) from CVA -risk-capital requirements . 
 
"9    See Basel III Endgame Proposal, 88 Fed. Reg. 64028 , at 64168 -64170.  The application of CVA -risk-capital requirements to derivatives transactions with commercial "
end-users would undermine legislative and regulatory relief afforded to commercial end-users 
under the final SA-CCR  rule and through margin and clearing  exemptions .10 Application to such 
"transactions would be especially impact ful to commercial end -users, which  are exempt from "
"margin requirements . As Congress has recognized , derivative s transactions  with commercial end-"
"users are risk -reducing to the broader financial system  and, therefore , exempting such transactions "
"from the CVA -risk-capital requirements would not contribute to systemic risk . Indeed, the Basel "
III Endgame Proposal could increase  risks to the broader financial system by reducing large bank 
offerings of hedging transactions . This could leave end -users unable to hedge their risks or forced 
"to go to unregulated, riskier counterparties to hedge their risks.  "
"Such an exemption also would be entirely consistent with the proposal adopted by  the EU, which "
expressly exempts commercial end-users from CVA  in recognition of the reduced risk associated 
"with such transactions. Absent a corresponding exemption under the Basel III Endgame Proposal, "
U.S. commercial end -users engaged in derivatives transactions with large banking organizations 
"would be placed at a material disadvantage  vis-à-vis their non-U.S. competitors.  Additionally, "
exempting CVA hedges associated with client -facing derivatives activities would ensure that large 
banking organization s are not penalized for prudently managing their counterparty risk positions 
"where it is possible, via a variety of market hedging instruments.  "
"Finally , CVA risk for derivat ives transactions  with commercial end -users  are already capitalized "
for—and risk -managed by —large banking organizations through the application of the GMS  
"component of CCAR ; thus, including these transactions in CVA -risk-capital requirements is only "
"additive to existing capital requirement s, with no corresponding benefit to large banking "
"organizations, their counterparties or the broader financial system.  "
• The Coalition also urges the Federal Banking Agencies to exempt client cleared 
derivatives transaction from CVA -risk-capital requirements . 
"Simply put, there is no CVA risk for large banks associated with client cleared derivatives "
"transaction activity . In fact, the Coalition respectfully submits that the Federal Banking Agencies "
"should be incentivizing this very type of transaction , given the significant broader financial "
"stability benefits  of clearing. Indeed, the UK’s Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) "
highlighted these points in its decision to retain the exemption from CVA -risk-capital requirements 
for client clearing transactions: “ The PRA proposes to retain the existing CRR exemption from 
"CVA capital requirements for client clearing transactions, given that the PRA considers their risk "
"to be low due to high levels of collateralisation, and the broader systemic benefits of clearing .”11 "
"As alluded to immediately above, such an exemption also would be consistent with the proposals "
"set forth in the EU and UK. Absent an exemption, U.S. commercial end-users hedging their risks "
with large banking organizations would be placed at a material disadvantage  vis-à-vis their non-
"U.S. competitors engaging in the same activity with an EU or UK bank , a seemingly bad result "

"11  Bank of England, Consultation Paper 16/22 – Implementation of the Basel 3.1 standards , § 7.12 "
"(November  30, 2022), available at : https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential -"
regulation/publication/2022/november/implementation -of-the-basel -3-1-standards . (with very real adverse consequences) given the immaterial risk of such transactions to large 
banking organizations  and the broader financial stability benefits from hedging  transactions .12 
IV.  FRTB  
• The Coalition urges the Federal Banking Agencies to make substantive changes to 
FRTB to avoid the double counting of market risks under the Basel III Endgame 
"Proposal  and the GMS component of CCAR or, failing that, to delay the implementation "
of FRTB until a holistic review has been performed across FRTB and the GMS 
component of CCAR . 
"The new market risk component of the Basel III Endgame P roposal, known as FRTB, has been "
calibrated to require large banking organizations to capitalize for market risk assuming a period of 
market stress. The global market shock component of CCAR also require s large banking 
organizations to capital ize for market risk assuming a period of market stress . FRTB was calibrated 
and finalized by the Basel Committee without regard for the U.S. CCAR stress tests. The Federal 
Banking Agencies have not made meaningful modifications to FRTB in the Basel III Endgame 
"Proposal. Therefore, FRTB is completely additive with the GMS component of CCAR. This leads  "
"to capital requirements significantly higher than appropriate given the underlying risk , resulting in "
"redundancy, overlap and inefficiency in the broader capital framework. Federal Reserve Governor  "
Bowman urged such consideration in her statement in dissent of the Basel III Endgame Proposal:  
"Rather than considering piecemeal changes to risk -based capital rules, in my view, "
"regulators should review the entirety of these rules, and where possible, find ways "
to rationalize requirements. … [The Basel III Endgame Proposal] is intended to 
"improve risk capture, but in some circumstances, leaves in place and even "
"introduces new regulatory redundancies, as with changes to the market risk capital "
"rule, credit valuation adjustments, and operational risk that overlap with stress "
testing requirements and th e stress capital buffer. It is not clear whether or when 
"we will revisit the broader set of capital rules to address redundancy and overlap, "
but doing so could significantly improve the efficiency of the capital framework.13 
The Coalition urges the Federal Banking Agencies to make substantive changes to the Basel III 
Endgame Proposal  to avoid the effective double counting of market risks under FRTB and the 
"GMS component of CCAR. Absent such changes, the Coalition urges the Federal Banking "
Agencies to delay the implementation of FRTB until a more holistic review of its calibration with 
the GMS has been fully performed  and analyzed .  
"Furthermore, the new “Non -Mode llable Risk Factor ,” or NMRF,  component significantly "
increase s capital on the types of bespoke and tailored derivative hedging transactions that 
"commercial end -users, pension funds, mutual funds and insurance companies utilize to efficiently "
and safely manage their business risks . In the absence of substantive changes to the Proposal or 
 
"12    For example, the inclusion of client cleared derivatives would particularly disadvantage the U.S. farming and "
agriculture industry.  
"13    Statement by Federal Reserve Governor Michelle W. Bowman , supra , note 4. delaying the implementation of FRTB, the Coalition urges that  transactions with commercial end-"
users and associated hedges  should be exempt from the FRTB ’s NMRF . 
V.  Public Listing Requirement  
• The Coalition urges the Federal Banking Agencies to eliminate the Public Listing 
Requirement from the final rule . 
"The Basel III Endgame Proposal’s inclusion of a reduced, 65% risk weight for derivatives with "
investment -grade counterparties is an important recognition of the fact that differences exist 
"between corporations, and an exposure to an established, creditworthy counterparty need not be "
"capitalized in the same way as an exposure to a newer, more growth -oriented company, even under "
"the existing counterparty credit framework ( i.e., SA -CCR). However , under the Basel III Endgame "
"Proposal, to be eligible for the reduced credit -risk-capital requirement for investment -grade  "
"corporate exposures, the company (or  its parent) must have securities outstanding on a recognized "
national securities exchange  or foreign equivalent.  
"In its current form, the Basel III Endgame Proposal would significantly penalize exposures to "
"highly creditworthy corporations, agriculture and food processing entities, energy producers, "
"corporate pensions and mutual funds , among others,  simply because they are not publicly listed . "
The requirement is misplaced because a public listing does not directly correspond to heightened 
creditworthiness nor does it reduce risk of default vis -à-vis an unlisted commercial end -user. Stock 
exchanges like the NASDAQ and New York Stock Exchange do not incorporate creditworthiness 
"into their listing criteria . Relatedly, a privately held company doe s not have diminished "
"“creditworthiness” or an increased risk of default simply because it is privately held. Finally, the "
EU and UK regulators’ implementation proposals do not include the Public Listing Requirement 
in recognition of those realities. Removing the Public Listing Requirement from the final rule 
"would ensure greater consistency between the Basel III Endgame Proposal, as implemented, and "
"the EU and UK proposals, promote a level playing field among the jurisdictions and ensure that "
credit -risk-capital requirements are applied in a manner commensurate with a counterparties’ 
actual credit risks and not assigned a higher or lower risk rating (and correspondingly lower or 
higher capital charge) based on a factor that is not solely determinative of cr editworthiness.  
VI.  Inclusion of OTC Client Clearing in the Complexity and Interconnectedness 
Indicators of the GSIB Surcharge  
• The Coalition urges the Federal Reserve to continue to exclude OTC client cleared 
transactions from the complexity and interconnectedness indicators of the GSIB 
surcharge . 
The GSIB Surcharge Proposal would significantly increase the capital required for large banking 
"organizations’ derivatives clearing businesses, which will introduce barriers to end -users in "
"accessing cleared OTC derivatives services, including reduced availability and higher costs.  "
"Additionally, this runs contrary to the public policy objectives of the G20 and the Dodd -Frank Act "
"clearing mandates, which were intended to reduce complexity and interconnectedness in the financial system —and have safely and effectively done so .14 If adopted in its current form, the "
GSIB Surcharge Proposal will exacerbate capacity challenges facing the clearing ecosystem today 
and make central clearing more expensive to end -users. If end -users must pay more to continue 
hedging their risks in a safe and prudent manner that contributes both to their own stability and the 
"stability of the broader financial system and U.S. economy, the costs will ultimately be borne by "

VII. Conclusion  
"Derivatives end -users  would be materially adversely affected by the adoption  of the CVA , FRTB, "
"and Public Listing Requirement  as proposed , as well as the Federal Reserve’s proposal to amend "
the GSIB surcharge framework . These aspects of the Proposal s would lead to significant 
"disruption s in the derivative markets, which would reduce market liquidity and efficiency, "
"particularly during periods of stress , and increase transaction  costs . Large banks would be required "
to either pass on those costs of higher capital to end -users and their customers or simply withdraw 
"from some capital markets activities altogether which, in the latter case, could shift activity to the "
"shadow banking system and away from the watchful eyes of U.S. regulators, which would increase "
"risk to financial stability , particularly during times of stress . Finally, these aspects of the Proposal s "
"would create, if implemented substantially as proposed, an uneven playing field for large U.S. "
"banking organ izations vis-à-vis their U.S. non -bank competitors and their non -U.S., international "
"bank competitors , thus impacting U.S. companies that rely on those U.S. banking organizations to "
manage their risks . This result dictates that the Federal Banking Agencies align with the sensible 
"approaches that regulators in the EU, UK and other jurisdictions have proposed or implemented.  "
We therefore urge the Federal Banking Agencies to re -propose the Basel III Endgame Proposal 
"and GSIB Surcharge Proposal with the recommendations and data cited above. Short of that, as "
"described  herein , we believe substantial modifications to the Proposals are critical . "
