I am writing to express my concern with the proposal to raise capital requirements on banks and the negative impact 
that it would have on Black families in Minnesota and across the country. Raising capital requirements on banks will only 
worsen the economic disparities that burden Black communities in more ways than one. 
Higher capital requirements will make it more difficult for Black homebuyers to obtain loans to purchase homes. We 
know that homeownership is one of the ways in which people can build generational wealth and Black Americans are 
"already at a huge disadvantage when it comes to this. According to a Politico article, only about 46 percent of Black "
"Americans own their homes, in comparison to 75 percent of white Americans. "
"Additionally, this proposal would also make it difficult for Black‐owned small businesses to grow. Many small business "
owners rely on bank loans to maintain and expand their businesses. Increasing capital requirements could limit their 
"ability to secure the financing they need. This could lead to less job opportunities in communities of color, as well as "
deter the growth of these businesses. 
These concerns should be taken seriously. We need to work towards a more inclusive financial system that will not 
hinder growth in communities of color while boosting the broader economy.
