"Dear FDIC, "
As a sm
"all business owner, I am worried about how an  increase in capital require ments could have negative "
repercussions for small businesses and the overall ec onomy. If banks are required to hold more capital as a 
"buffer against potential losses, they will have less money available for lending. This means that small "
"businesses, which often rely on loan s to finance their operations, expansion, and investment, may find it more "
difficult to access the capital they need. This reduced lending capacity could curb the growth and development 
"of small businesses, which are vital to ec onomic activity in Arizona and nationwide. "
"In addition to making less loans available, increasing cap ital requirements would incr ease the cost of borrowing, "
meaning that small businesses would face higher costs even  if they can secure financing. If small businesses 
"face greater obstacles to accessing cap ital due to increased ca pital requirements on banks, the overall economic "
"growth may suffer. Slower economic growth can have negative consequences for employment, wage growth, "
and overall prosperity. 
"The Biden administration has shown their support fo r small business post-pandemic, boosting them through "
federal aid. A proposal of this calib er threatens any success and improvement that our small businesses have 
"seen in the past couple of years. It is vital that you reconsider an increase to  capital requirements on banks, "
given the unfavorable conditions it would presen t to small businesses and our overall economy.
