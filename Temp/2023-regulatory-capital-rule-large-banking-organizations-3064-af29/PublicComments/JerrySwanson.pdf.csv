"My name is Jerry Swanson, and I am a personal inve stor with a keen interest in real estate, "
"particularly in rural areas. Over the years, I ha ve witnessed firsthand the tr ansformative power of "
access to capital in these regions. Rural communi ties often face limited economic opportunities and 
access to financial resources. It is  my firm belief that imposing stri ngent capital requirements could 
have a detrimental effect on t hese already underserved areas.  
Access to capital is essential for rural communities to thrive and grow. It allows local businesses to 
"expand, farmers to invest in modern equipment, and individuals to pursue homeownership. By "
"imposing excessive capital requirements, we risk stifling economic growth in these areas, causing "
"businesses to close, limiting job opportunities, and making it even harder for residents to access "
"financial services. The very essence of rural life, with its tight-knit communities and close "
"relationships, is at stake.  "
"It’s important to note that increasi ng capital requirements for our banks is unnecessary, in addition to "
"being harmful to underserved communities. Accordi ng to Treasury Secretar y Janet Yellen, our "
banking system is “really safe and well-capitalized.”  
"Over the past year, the Federal Reserve has d iligently undertaken commendable efforts in combating "
inflation. It is vital that federal regulators cont inue to make decisions that will not be disadvantageous 
to our most vulnerable communities. I  implore the Federal Reserve to take into account the needs 
and aspirations of rural communities in its decis ion-making process regarding capital requirements. 
"By doing so, we can ensure that these areas conti nue to flourish and contribute to the strength and "
diversity of our great nation.
