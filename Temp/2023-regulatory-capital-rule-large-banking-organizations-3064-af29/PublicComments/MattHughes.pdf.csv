The community of Hills
borough has continued to try and ma ke do of the tough economic times that have hit our 
"town. This extends to our area’s housing market, where things remain very competitive as families attempt to "
buy their first home. Things may now only get worse from  here as debate conti nues over whether to pass a 
regulation that would increase capital requirements for U.S. banks. 
This rule is set to have dire effects on first time  homebuyers trying to achieve a key piece of the American 
"dream. According to the Mortgage Banke rs Association, credit av ailability for homes is  already the tightest it "
"has been in a decade, something that is only bound to ge t worse with this regulation. This is issued from the "
reality that higher bank capital requir ements would force banks to provide  fewer borrowing options at a more 
"expensive rate. As a result, we would face an unprecedente d affordability crisis that would leave families across "
Hillsborough and North Carolina looking on the outside of the housing market for years. 
"We don’t have to enforce this regulation to strengthen th e reserves of our nation’s ba nks. In fact, U.S. banks "
"already have one of the highest capital  requirements in the world, while also being mandated to key financial "
stress tests that ensure they are well equipped for fu ture economic downturns. Our economic leaders have added 
"to this, with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen reassuring us that “the American banking system is really safe and "
"well-capitalized, it's resilient.” All this makes it clear th at this is an unnecessary regulation for the country’s "
banking system. 
"We must continue to work hard to ensure that owni ng a home remains a part of the American dream, not a "
fragment of it. That’s why Presiden t Biden and Vice President Harris have worked relentlessly to provide this 
opportunity to all Americans over the last  few years. Let’s make sure that we continue their efforts to make 
housing affordable by rejecting the proposal to raise capital requirements.
