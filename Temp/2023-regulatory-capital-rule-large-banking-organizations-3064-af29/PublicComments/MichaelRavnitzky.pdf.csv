Regulatory Capital Rule: Revised Framework for Determining Risk-Based Capital 
Requirements for Large Banking Organizations and Banking Organizations With 
Significant Trading Activity 
Docket ID OCC-2021-0009 (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency) 
Docket R-1813 (Federal Reserve System) 
Docket RIN 3064-AF29 (FDIC) 
I am writing as a private individual and banking customer to provide my comments on 
the proposed rule that would revise the capital requirement s for large banking 
"organizations and banking organizations with significant trading activity, as published in "
the Federal Register. I appreciate the opportunity to share my views on this important and 
complex issue. 
INTRODUCTION 
The banking sector is the backbone of the economy. providing essential financial services 
"and intermediation to households, businesses, and governments. However , the banking "
"sector is also vulnerable to various risks and shocks, such as credit risk, operational risk, "
"market risk, and credit valuation adjustment risk. These risks can materialize in different "
"ways, such as defaults, frauds, losses, or valuation changes, and cause significant damage "
to the banks' balance sheets and capital positions. When these risks become too severe or 
"widespread, they can trigger banking failures and collapses , which can have devastating "
consequences for the financial stability and economic growth of the nation. 
The history of the U.S. banking sector is marked by several episodes of banking failures 
and collapses that have exposed the weaknesses and gaps in the regulatory and 
supervisory framework. Some of the most notable examples are: 
The Savings and Loan Crisis of the 1980s and early 1990s. which involved the failure of 
"more than 1,000 savings and loan associations (S&Ls) due lo risky lending practices , "
"high interest rates, deregulation , fraud, and mismanagement. The crisis cost taxpayers "
about $132 billion and contributed to the recession of 1990-1991. 
"The Subprime Mortgage Crisis and the Global Financial Cd~is of 2007-2009, which "
involved the collapse of several large banks and financial institutions due to their 
exposure to subprime mortgages and complex derivatives . The crisis triggered a global 
"credit crunch, a severe recession , and a massive government intervention. The crisis cost "
"the U.S. economy about $22 trillion in lost output and wealth. The Archegos Capital Management Collapse ofMarch 20~3, which involved the failure "
of a family office that had leveraged positions in several stocks through derivatives 
"contracts with multiple banks. When the stock prices declined sharply, Archegos was "
"unable to meet its margin calls, triggering a fire sale of its assets and causing billions of "
dollars of losses for its lenders. 
The Wells Fargo bank issues involved the creation of millions of unauthorized accounts 
and credit cards by Wells Fargo employees to meet aggressive sales targets and earn 
"incentives. The candal, which was revealed in 20) 6, re ulted in regulatory fines, legal "
"settlements, reputational damage, and customer defections for Wells Fargo. The proposed "
rule would have addressed this issue by requiring banking organizations to use a 
"standardized approach for operational risk capital requirem ents, which would capture "
"some aspects of operational risk, such as fraud, litigation, or misconduct. The "
standardized approach would also reduce the complexity and variability of the capital 
framework and enhance the comparability and reliability of capital ratios across banking 
organizations. This would facilitate more effective supervisory and market assessments 
of capital adequacy and deter or detect any unethical or illegal practices by banking 
organizations. 
These banking failures and collapses have revealed some of the common causes and 
"factors that have undermined the safety and soundness of the banking sector, such as: "
• Inadequate capital requirements that do not reflect the actual risks and impacts of 
banks' exposures. 
"• Complex and inconsistent capital framework that allows for manipulation , "
"variability , or lack of validation of capital calculations . "
• Lack of transparency and comparability of capital ratios across banks and over 
time. 
• Incentives for regulatory arbitrage and capital optimization that may increase 
systemic risk or undermine financial stability. 
• Competitive disadvantages for U.S. banks relative to their foreign counterparts due 
to differences in regulatory treatment or standards. 
"To address these issues and challenges, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency , the "
"Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Federal Deposit Insurance "
Corporation ( collectively the agencies) have issued a proposed rule that would revise the 
capital requirements for large banking organizations (those with total assets of $100 
billion or more) and banking organizations with significant trading activity. The proposed 
rule aims to: 
2 • Improve the calculation of risk-based capital requirements to better reflect the 
"risks of these banking organizations' exposures, such as credit risk, operational "
"risk, market risk, and credit valuation adjustment risk. "
• Reduce the complexity of the framework by replacing the current internal model 
approaches for credit and operational. risk with standardized approaches that are 
more transparent and consistent. 
• Enhance the consistency of requirements across these banking organizations by 
applying the same treatment of unrealized gains and losses on certain securities 
"and other components of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), "
"capital deductions , and rules for minority interest. "
• Facilitate more effective supervisory and market assessments of capital adequacy 
by aligning the U.S. capital framework with the international capital standards 
issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. 
The proposed rule seems to be well crafted to reduce the chances of future banking 
failures and collapses without impairing the vitality of the banking sector. The proposed 
rule would ensure that these banking organizations hold more and higher quality capital 
to withstand potential shocks and reduce their likelihood or severity of failure. The 
proposed rule would also improve the alignment of regulatory requirements with actual 
"risks and impacts, which would increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the capital "
framework. The proposed rule would also promote financial stability and market 
discipline by reducing regulatory arbitrage opportunities and increasing global 
consistency of capital requirements. 
The proposed rule is a significant step forward in strengthening the resilience and 
performance of the U.S. banking sector. It is based on the lessons learned from past 
"banking crises and failures, as well as on the current and emerging risks and challenges "
that the banking sector faces. 
RESPONSES TO POTENTIAL CRITICISMS 
"The proposed rule may face some criticism from some industry commenters , as discussed "
"below. This is in spite of the many historic banking incidents that have occmTed, and the "
"vulnerabilities that the financial industry has from increased interrelationships , linkages, "
and scenarios such as derivatives counterparty risks. 
3 Standardized Approach versus Internal Model Approaches 
The proposed rule would replace the internal model approaches for credit and operational 
risk capital requirements with standardized approaches that are more transparent and 
"consistent. However , some might argue that this would also reduce the risk sensitivity "
"and accuracy of the capital framework , as the standardized approaches may not capture "
"the specific risk profiles and diversification benefits of different banks. Further, they "
would say that the agencies should allow banks to use internal models for credit and 
"operational risk capital requirements , subject to appropriate validation and calibration "
"standards , to better reflect the actual risks and impacts of their exposures. "
"In fact, the proposed rule would improve the transparency and consistency of the "
"capital framework, as the internal model approaches have been subject to "
"manipulation, inconsistency, or lack of validation. The standardized approaches would "
"also enhance the comparability and reliability of capital ratios across banks, which would "
facilitate more effective supervisory and market assessments of capital adequacy . The 
agencies have calibrated the standardized approaches to be broadly consistent with the 
"internal model approaches in terms of aggregate capital requirements , and they have also "
provided some adjustments and options for banks to account for their specific risk 
profiles and diversification benefits. 
Alignment With International Capital Standards 
The proposed rule would align the U.S . capital framework with the international capital 
"standards issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision , which have introduced "
new methodologies and parameters for market risk and credit valuation adjustment risk. 
"However , some would argue that this would also introduce new sources of volatility and "
"complexity in the capital calculations , which would affect the hedging strategies and risk "
management practices of tanks. They would say that the agencies should review the 
calibration and design of the revised market risk and credit valuation ad_iustment risk 
frameworks to ensure that they are consistent with the objectives of the proposal and do 
not introduce undue volatility or complexity in the capital calculations. 
"In fact, the proposed rule would improve the risk sensitivity and transparency of the "
"capital framework , as the revised market risk and credit valuation adjustment risk "
frameworks would better reflect the potential losses from market movements and 
counterparty credit risk. The alignment with the international capital standards 
"would also promote financial stability and market discipline, as it would reduce "
regulatory arbitrage opportunities and increase global consistency of capital 
requirements. The agencies have considered the impact of volatility and complexity in 
"the calibration and design of the revised frameworks , and they have also provided some "
simplifications and exemptions for banks to reduce their operational and compliance 
costs. 
4 Expansion of Risk Based Approach 
The proposed rule would expand the risk-based approach to capture all material sources 
"ofrisk that banks face, such as credit risk, operational risk, market risk, and credit "
valuation adjustment risk. Some might argue that this would also create incentives for 
"regulatory arbitrage and capital optimization , as banks may try to avoid or reduce their "
exposures to certain types of risk or shift their activities to less regulated or more 
favorable jurisdictions . They would prefer that the agencies monitor and address any 
potential incentives for regulatory arbitrage and capital optimization that may arise from 
"the expanded risk-based approach , such as by applying additional supervisory measures "
or adjusting the risk weights or capital buffers as needed. 
"In fact, the proposed rule would ensure that banks hold sufficient capital to absorb "
"potential losses from any source of risk, which would enhance their resilience and "
reduce their likelihood or severity of failure. The expanded risk-based approach would 
"also improve the alignment of regulatory requirements with actual risks and impacts, "
which would increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the capital framework. The 
agencies have taken into account the potential incentives for regulatory arbitrage and 
"capital optimization in the design and calibration of the expanded risk-based approach , "
and they have also established some safeguards and constraints to prevent or mitigate 
such behavior. 
Treatment of Unrealized Gains and Loses Compared with Foreign Counterparts 
The proposed rule would apply the same treatment of unrealized gains and losses on 
"certain securities and other components of AOC!, capital deductions , and rules for "
minority interest across all large banking organizations . Some may argue that this would 
also create competitive disadvantages for U.S . banks relative to their foreign 
"counterparts , especially in tenns of operational risk capital requirements and the "
treatment of AOC!. They would prefer that the agencies coordinate with their 
"international counterparts to ensure a level playing field for U.S. banks, especially in "
terms of operational risk capital requirements and the treatment of AOC!. 
"In fact, the proposed rule would enhance the consistency and simplicity of the capital "
"framework, as it would eliminate some of the differences in treatment that currently "
"exist across large banking organizations . The consistent treatment of AOCI, capital "
"deductions , and rules for minority interest would also improve the quality and "
comparability of capital across large banking organizations . The agencies have 
coordinated with their international counterparts to ensure that the U.S. capital 
"framework is broadly consistent with the international capital standards , while also taking "
into account some specific characteristics or circumstances of U.S. banks. 
5 SUGGESTIONS 
"Suggestion to Mitigate the Impact on Community Banks, Credit Unions, and "
Smaller/Less Complex Banking Organizations 
The proposed rule would revise the capital requirements for large banking organizations 
(those with total assets of $ 100 billion or more) and banking organizations with 
significant trading activity. However. the proposed rule may also have some indirect 
or spillover effects on other types of financial institutions that are not subject to the 
"proposed rule, such as community banks, smaller or less complex banking "
"organizations, and credit unions. These effects may include: "
"• Changes in the competit ive landscape and market dynamics of the banking sector, "
as the proposed rule may create some advantages or disadvantages for large 
banking organizations and banking organization s with significant trading activity 
relative to other types of financial institution s. 
"• Changes in the risk profiles and exposures of other types of financial institution s, "
as they may be exposed to some ofthe same risks or shocks that affect large 
banking organizatiom and banking organizations with significant trading activity. 
"• Changes in the expectations and standards of regulators , supervisors, auditors, "
"rating agencies, investors, customers, and other stakeholder s for other types of "
"financial institutio ns, as the proposed rule may raise the bar for capital adequacy "
and risk management for large banking organizations and banking organizations 
with significant trading activity. 
To mitigate these potential issues. I respectfu lly suggest that the agencies consider some 
"possible modifications or additions to the proposed rnle, such as: "
• Providing some guidance or clarification on how the proposed rnle would affect 
"community banks, smaller or less complex banking organizations , and credit "
"unions, and how they should prepare for or respond to the potential changes in the "
regulatory environment and market conditions . 
• Monitoring and addressing any potential spillo er effects or competitive pressures 
that may arise from the proposed rule for community banks smal ler or less 
"complex banking organizations and credit unions, and ensuring that they are not "
subject to undue costs or constraints. 
"• Coordinating with other regulators or supervisors that oversee community banks, "
"smaller or less complex banking organizations , and credit unions, including the "
"6 National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), to ensure a consistent and "
proportionate approach to capital regulation and supervision. 
Suggestion Regarding Risks of Quantum Computing on Banking Security 
I acknowledge that this particular suggestion is outside the . cope of the proposed rule 
but it should be taken into consideration in future planning for banking regulation. 
The proposed rule may not adequately address the potential risks of quantum computing 
on banking security and cryptography . Quantum computing is a technology that uses 
"quantum mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement. to perform "
computations that are faster and more powerful than classical computers. Quantum 
computers can potentially break some of the cryptographic methods and protocols that 
"banks rely on to protect their data, transactions, and customers from unauthorized acces , "
"modification , or theft. "
"Quantum computing poses a potential threat to banking security and cryptography , as "
quantum computers can potentially break some of the cryptographic methods and 
"protocols that banks rely on. For example, quantum computers can use Shor's algorithm "
"to factor large numbers or find discrete logarithms in polynomial time, which would "
render RSA and ECC encryption schemes vulnerable. Quantum computers can also use 
Grover's algorithm to search large databa e or find collisions in ha h functions in 
"quadratic time, which would reduce the se1.:urity ofsymmetric encryption schemes or "
digital signatures . 
The emergence of a working quantum computer of sufficient scale ( enough qubits) that 
can defeat cryptographic systems used by banks could have catastrophic consequences 
for the banking sector and the economy . Such a scenario could compromise the 
"confidentiality , integrity, and availability of banking data, transaction , c1nd customers , "
"and cause massive losses, frauds, breaches , or thefts. It could also trigger a banking crisis, "
"failure, panic, or disruption , and reduce trust and confidence in the banking system. "
"I suggest that the agencies do more to address this potential risk, such as: "
• Providing some guidance or clarification on how quantum computing could affect 
banking security and cryptography. and how banks should prepare for or respond 
to the potential changes in the threat landscape and technology environment. 
• Monitoring and addressing any developments or advances in quantum computing 
"that could pose a threat to banking security and cryptography , and ensut ing that "
banks are aware of and prepared for such cenarios. 
• Coordinating with other regulators or supervisors that oversee ballking security 
"and cryptography , such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology "
"7 (NIST), to ensure a consistent and proactive approach to quantum-resistant "
cryptography. 
Each financial regulator and financial institution ought to use this window of time before 
quantum computers appear to look at each element in their systems to identify vulnerable 
places to quantum computers and take steps to reduce those vulnerabilities and plan for 
changes that would reduce reliance on encryption schemes that would be vulnerable. This 
would help to enhance the resilience and preparedness of the banking sector for the 
potential challenges and opportunities of quantum computing . 
I recognize that NIST and other agencies may already be working on developing and 
"implementing quantum-resistant cryptography and standards , and may be coordinating "
"with financial regulators, but this may not be sufficiently at the forefront of banking "
regulation to address the urgency and magnitude of the quantum computing threat. The 
"agencies should increase their efforts and resources , and enlist the banking entities on a "
"cooperative basis, to ensure that the banking ector is adequately prepared and protected "
from the potential risks of quantum computing.
