"Good afternoon,  "
"On behalf of State Representative Upchurch, the President of the Ohio  Legislative Black Caucus and a "
"dedicated member of the Agriculture and Economic and Workforce Development Committees, I wish to "
express my concerns about the proposal to raise capital  requirements on banks. I believe that an increase in 
"capital requirements may have adverse consequences on our local and national econo my, particularly on small "
businesses and minority families. 
"The proposed increase in capital requirements would limit the ability of banks to le nd to businesses, both large "
"and small. Small businesses often rely on loans and credit  lines to fund their operation s, invest in growth, and "
"create jobs. By setting strict er capital requirements, banks may be less w illing to extend credit to entrepreneurs "
"and small business owners, ultimately hampering their ability to thrive and contribute to economic growth. "
"Furthermore, minority families often face barriers to accessing capital, which can be exacerbated by higher "
"capital requirements. With increased costs for banks, they might become more cau tious in lending to these "
"communities, limiting opportunities for owning homes, obtaining an educati on, and entrepreneurial ventures. "
"The potential consequences of raising capital requirements on banks in clude reduced economic growth, job "
"creation, and opportunities for minority communities, all of which could hi nder our overall economic recovery "
and stability. The Biden-Harris admi nistration has worked to boost our economy through aid to our small 
businesses and families. This proposal could upset any im provement seen in the past couple of years. That’s 
why I respectfully request that you oppose this measure.
