RE: The Impact of Proposed Bank Regulatory Capital Requirements on Tax Equity Investment in 
Clean Energy   
"Dear Director Brainard,  "
"On behalf of the undersigned organizations, we are writing to express our profound concerns about "
proposed bank regulatory capital requir ements that threaten to derail the clean energy transition.     
The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has key goals which will benefit Americans: substantially lower the 
"nation’s carbon emissions, catalyze investments in energy production and manufacturing, c reate good "
"jobs, and lower energy costs. Providing efficient, low -cost capital is a key ingredient to accomplishing "
these goals.    
"Tax equity, largely provided by domestic banks, has been a critical financing source for clean energy "
projects. The IRA ext ended and expanded the use of federal tax incentives to various renewable and 
carbon emission reduction technologies as well as the domestic manufacturing of advanced energy 
"equipment. To meet the goals of the IRA, many forecasters estimate that tax equity  will need to increase "
from a $20 billion annual market to $50 billion. Banks are poised to increase their tax equity investments 
"to meet this demand. However, impending changes in bank regulatory capital requirements by banking "
"regulators would quadruple the capital requirement on tax equity investment, which is not reflective of its "
risk profile and could severely reduce banks’ capacity in providing tax equity.    
Substantially higher capital costs for banks could significantly increase the costs of clea n energy projects 
"and result in far fewer projects being built. Furthermore, carbon reduction goals may not be met, jobs "
"could be lost, manufacturing could be stunted, and equitable access to clean, low -cost energy could be "
reduced – all of which are incon sistent with the administration’s climate initiatives and the IRA.    
"Tax equity is not traditional private equity investment, but a unique form of equity with "
loan-like characteristics  
The U.S. government has incentivized the energy transition through the tax code. Renewable energy 
"projects typically have a high level of contracted revenue, limited variable operating costs and relatively "
predictable cash flows. Projects are often held in  a limited liability corporation (LLC) and taxed as 
"partnerships. In most cases, the project sponsors do not have sufficient tax liabilities to efficiently use the "
"tax benefits that may be available for these projects. Thus, the Sponsor sells non -controlli ng passive "
interests in the LLC to tax equity investors in a structured tax equity transaction. This structure is 
designed to allow tax equity investors to fund a large portion of the capital cost of the project and to 
receive a pre -negotiated rate of retu rn which consists primarily of the value of available tax credits and 
other tax benefits. The tax equity investor has limited downside exposure as the tax equity investment will 
"receive most of its return from more predictable tax credits and other tax ben efits, and it has other American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE)  "

"protective features such as no senior debt in the project, and its priority over a sponsor’s return. In many "
ways tax equity has more loan -like characteristics versus true equity investments.   
"Domestic b anks have been major providers of tax equity, representing over 80 -90% of the roughly $20 "
"billion annual market. In fact, in a recognition of the importance of tax equity financing and its loan "
"equivalent nature, in 2021, the Office of the Comptroller of t he Currency (OCC) codified and streamlined "
the process for the banks to participate in tax equity financing under the general lending authority.1 Many 
banks have increased their tax equity financing since the OCC rulemaking.    
While the IRA provides new tax credit monetization options through transferable tax credits and direct 
"pay, tax equity is expected to remain the most common and preferred option for project developers given "
its ability to monetize both tax credits and other tax benefits such as tax depreciation. Tax equity also 
"provides additional value to developers in the form of long -term commitments to fund projects, which the "
"developers can use to raise construction finance, and can help facilitate the entrance of large buyers into "
the still dev eloping tax credit transfer market by providing underwriting and project diligence expertise.   
The treatment of tax equity in the proposed capital requirements is both unwarranted and 
particularly detrimental to IRA -incentivized projects  
"Under existin g regulatory capital rules, tax equity receives a 100% risk weight so long as a bank’s total "
equity investments are below 10% of its capital. The excess equity investments exceeding 10% of a 
"bank’s capital would be assessed at 400% risk weight, i.e., quadr upling the capital requirement.   "
"The Federal Reserve, OCC, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued a Notice of "
"Proposed Rule (NPR) on the finalization of Basel III rules on July 27, 2023. As part of the proposal’s "
"bank regulatory capital rules, there is no longer a 10% threshold test. Instead, the proposed rules provide a "
100% risk weight for public welfare investments such as the low -income housing tax credit investments. 
All other non -publicly traded equity investments (which renewable e nergy tax equity investments would 
be grouped into) attract a 400% risk weight.   
Applying the same risk weighting for tax equity as private equity is unwarranted and ignores the fact that 
tax equity investments have a very different risk profile as discu ssed above. A 400% risk weight would 
make it prohibitively expensive for the banks to extend tax equity financing. Leading tax equity providers 
1 Section  12 CFR § 7.1025  allows National Banks to engage in tax equity finance transactions and defines the 
criteria that make these investments the “functional equivalent of a loan”.   (1) The structure of the trans action is 
necessary for making the tax credits or other tax benefits available to the national bank or Federal savings 
"association; (2) The transaction is of limited tenure and is not indefinite, including retaining a limited investment "
interest that is re quired by law to obtain continuing tax benefits or needed to obtain the expected rate of return; (3) 
The tax benefits and other payments received by the national bank or Federal savings association from the 
transaction repay the investment and provide the expected rate of return at the time of underwriting; (4) Consistent 
"with paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the national bank or Federal savings association does not rely on appreciation "
of value in the project or property rights underlying the project for repayment; (5) The national bank or Federal 
savings association uses underwriting and credit approval criteria and standards that are substantially equivalent to 
the underwriting and credit approval criteria and standards used for a traditional commercial loan; (6) The national 
bank or Federal savings association is a passive investor in the transaction and is unable to direct the affairs of the 
project company; and (7) The national bank or Federal savings association appropriately accounts for the transact ion 
initially and on an ongoing basis and has documented contemporaneously its accounting assessment and 
conclusion . American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE)

"anticipate that annual t ax equity investments in the clean ener gy sector could shrink by 80-90%, and "
"many bank s could exit the renewabl e tax equit y market entirely, if t he 400% risk weight is applicable. "
The increas e in pricing that would be needed to accommodat e the 400% risk weight would be 
"astronomical, and t he project investment would no longer be viable for the developer if that cost is passed "
"along t o them. In fact, despi te the effective dat e of t he proposed rules being 2 025, this uncertaint y has "
alr
"eady caus ed m any bank investors to take a pause on issuing new investment commitments, which will "
cause a disrupti on to the project developments and put many thousands of manufacturi ng and construction 
jobs at risk.   
Recommendations 
"It is critical and advisabl e for the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC to exp and t he 100% risk weight "
category to include tax equity for renewabl e energy. Investment s in government-mandated clean energy 
tax credits shoul d not be subject to Basel III’s punitive requirements for equity exposures for reasons 
similar t o those applicabl e t o equit y investment s in low-income housi ng credit (LIHTC) inve stments. 
"Although the ri sk profile of renewable energy investment s is substantially similar to LIHTC investments, "
"and the level of government supp ort is comparabl e, renewable energy investment s do not qualify as "
communit y development investments. Updates are necessar y to afford them the s ame treatment.  
We recomm end that the 100% risk weight category in “Table 2: Risk Weights Applicable to Equity 
Exposures under the Expanded Simple Risk- Weight Approach (ESRWA)” on page 162 of the NPR to 
include two additional categories: (1) investments that meet the stringent criteria set by the OCC to 
"qualif y as l oan equivalent,2 and (2) the investment s that qualify for the proportional amo rtizati on method "
(PA
"M) of equity accounting under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) rules3 as they, by "
"definition, would derive most of their returns from federal tax incentives, similar to LIHTC investments. "
The table below shows the exposure types we recommend adding to the 100% risk weight category.  
Risk Weight  Equity Exposure  
100%  An equity exposure that qualifies as a community development investment under 
section 24 (Eleventh) of the National Bank Act.   
An equity exposure to an unconsolidated small business investment company or 
"held through a consolidated small business investm ent company, as described in "
section 302 of the Small Business Investment Act.   
An equity exposure that qualifies as a tax equity finance investment under 12 CFR 
"7.1025 and earns any of the following clean energy tax credits under sections 45, "
"45Y, 45Q, 45V, 45X, 45Z, 48, 48D, or 48E of the Internal Revenue Code, or future "
tax credits.   
An equity exposure to a tax credit structure that meets the criteria to be accounted 
for under the proportional amortization method as described in ASC 323 of the 
FASB’s  Accounting Standards Codification.
