I am writing to you today to make my concerns r egarding the potential implicat ions of raising capital 
"requirements on banks clear, particularly in relati on to underserved communities, including those in "
the rural areas of Montana.  
As a former Democratic State Representative who had the privilege of representing the rural districts 
"of Montana HD 12 and HD 93, I had the opportunity to witness the uni que challenges faced by people "
in these areas. Both of these districts encompass ru ral regions of Montana wher e access to credit for 
"housing, business and more is a matter of utmost importance.  "
Raising capital requirements on banks could exacerbate the c hallenges already faced by 
"underserved communities. These communities, whic h include many hardworking farmers, rely on the "
availability of credit to sustain t heir livelihoods and provide essential services to their constituents. By 
"increasing capital requirements, we risk limiting the access to credit, which is critical for the "
development and stability of these areas.  
I also wish to draw your attention to the fa ct that farmers often depend on loans to purchase 
"equipment, invest in their operations, and navigat e the ever-changing agricultural landscape. Any "
"additional barriers to obtaining credit, as could be imposed by higher capital requirements, would "
place an undue burden on our farmers and hinder their ability to cont ribute to our nation's food 
security.  
I respectfully urge the Federal Reserve to consider  the far-reaching consequences of raising capital 
"requirements on banks, especially for underserved co mmunities and the agricultural sector. While "
"ensuring the financial stability of our banking system is crucial, it is equally vital to strike a balance "
that allows these communities to thrive and grow.
