I am writing to express my strong opposition to the pr oposed increas
e in capital requirements and its 
potential impact on clean energy projec ts. I have significant experienc e  in government affairs and 
"environmental advocacy. During my  time at the  Montana Cons ervation Voters, I understood the "
importance of balancing financial stability with investments in a sustainabl e future. I believe that this 
proposal could have detrimental consequences fo r clean energy initiatives in Montana and beyond.  
"Clean energy projects play a crucial role in addressing climate change , reducing greenhouse gas "
"emissions, and promoting a healthier environment for our communities. These initiatives often require "
"tax equity financing, which as 45 clean energy companies pointed out in a letter will be made much "
more difficult with these new capital requirements r egulations.  This could slow down the transition to 
"clean energy sources, hindering our progre ss towards a more sustainable future.  "
Clean energy projects not only benefit the environment but also stimulate economic growth by 
creating jobs and attracting invest ments. A reduction in financing options due to higher capital 
requirements could stifle economic development in our region.  
I urge you to carefully consider the broader implic ations of increasing capital requirements and to 
explore alternative methods for ens uring financial stability that do not hinder clean energy progress. It 
is crucial to strike a balance that promot es both economic well-being and environmental 
sustainability.
