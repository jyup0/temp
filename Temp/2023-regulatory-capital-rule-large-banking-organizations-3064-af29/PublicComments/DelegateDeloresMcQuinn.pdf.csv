To Whom it May Concern: 
 
"As Chair of The Martin Luther King Commissi on, I have long aspired to live up to Dr. King’s "
beliefs and ideals throughout my career for pub lic service. This includes empowering Black 
families across our Commonwealth so that they ca n achieve the economic prosperity that they 
deserve. 
 
"It has come to my attention that these economic goals could now be in danger. Specifically, this "
is due to a proposal that would move to raise capital requireme nts for banks. This regulation 
"would stymie credit access for the Black families I represent in Charles City, Henrico, and "
Chesterfield counties. Banks would reduce the number of lo ans and services they offer 
"communities, as they would fear lending to anyone, they believe to be a risky investment. This "
"would only contribute to a nationw ide issue for Black Americans, who are statistically more "
"likely to be underbanked. Without a ccess to these financial tools, it can limit the ability for our "
communities to invest and grow.  
 
The consequences of this regulation could not be clearer when looking at the housing market. 
"Black families have historically struggled to save for the down payment of their first home, "
taking an average of 14 years just  to save for a 5% down payment.  With Virginia’s housing costs 
"remaining high statewide, they would be forced to save for even longer. Now, this new rule "
"could shut Black communities out of the market for years to come, as the banks would make it "
even more expensive to hold a mortgage. 
 
 
"It is critical that we give Virg inia’s Black families every opportunity  to purchase their first home, "
especially after having to battle  through housing discrimination for decades. We can continue to 
"take a step in this direction by dismissing th e proposed bank requireme nts regulation, given the "
negative economic impact it would have on housing. 
 
Sincerely. 
Delores McQuinn
