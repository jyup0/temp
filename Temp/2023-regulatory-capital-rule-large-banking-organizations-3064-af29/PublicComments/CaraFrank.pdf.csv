To  Whom i
"s may concern, "
My name is Cara Frank and I am the Founder and Pr esident of Six Fishes Acupuncture and also 
"China Herb Company, both based in  Philadlephia. I am also a proud graduate of Goldman Sachs "
10kSB program. 
I am thankful for the ability to have proudly owned my own business for over 30 years. It has enabled 
me to work and grow with the community that I ca ll home. We are so successful that we are now 
squeezed for space.  
"While I hope to obtain a loan soon to expand my pr actice, I am worried that a recent proposal to "
increase capital requirements for banks could complicate my ability to access capital. 
It is no secret that small business owners like myse lf rely on banks to provide us with fairly priced 
"loans. This was especially true during the COVI D-19 pandemic, when things were economically "
"bleak, but we were still able to keep the lights on and make sure our employees were paid appropriately. However, if we enact this regulati on, we would be cut off from quickly obtaining "
financing for our everyday business needs. This wo uld create a new economic challenge at a time 
where we are just beginning to get ov er the historically high inflatio n we were just experiencing.  
"At the same time, I am also confused as to why there is a push to raise bank capital requirements "
even further when they are already some of the highes t in the world. U.S. banks face stricter capital 
standards here compared to those in Europe. Not to mention that people like Treasury Secretary 
"Janet Yellen have said that “the American banking system is really safe and well-capitalized, it's resilient,” helping reassure that t he banking system is strong and prepared. "
I hope you sincerely consider rejecting this plan to raise capital requirements. Finalizing them could 
really hinder small businesses like my own from being able to find the money we need to grow and 
"expand, something I hope all fo lks have the opportunity to do. "
Small businesses are the backbone of America. You need to do ever ything possible to make money 
available to every one who qualifies.  
Thank you very much.
