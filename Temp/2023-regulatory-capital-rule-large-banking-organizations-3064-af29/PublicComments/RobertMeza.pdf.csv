"Dear FDIC, "
In m
"y capacity as a former Arizona State Representati ve and a dedicated advocate for the Latino community, I "
want to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule changes that seek to  increase capital requirements for 
banks in the United States. These changes pose a signifi cant threat to the accessibility  of loans for community 
members and could further restrict  the economic prospects of Latino Americans and other historically 
marginalized groups. 
These requirements would elevate interest rates for fi rst-time buyers and discour age lending to lower-income 
"borrowers, thus creating challenges for those least financially equipped to b ear such burdens. This impact is "
"particularly pronounced for Black and Latino Americans, who are overrepresen ted in these categories and have "
"historically faced discriminatory housing and credit pol icies, while simultaneously reducing the cost of "
borrowing for the already wealthy. Imposing these additional banking regulations is unnecessary and could have adverse effects. Leading experts at 
the Urban Institute argue that the proposed capital levels surpass what is necessary to safeguard banks from a 
"repeat of the Great Recession. The D odd-Frank Act, implemented after the 2008 crisis, has already strengthened "
"our banking system, and the Federal Reserve's assurances of ample capital and liquidity levels further underscore the unwarranted nature  of these proposed changes. "
"If implemented, this rule would undermine the substantial strides ma de by the Biden Administration and the "
Federal Reserve in fostering economic growth and equitable development in historically underserved 
communities. Penalizing banks for serving these commun ities runs counter to the administration's goals of 
narrowing the racial wealth gap and making homeownership more widely acce ssible. I urge you to reconsider 
these proposed requirements and work towards an econom y that is equitable for every person in the United 
States. 
Hon. Robert Meza
