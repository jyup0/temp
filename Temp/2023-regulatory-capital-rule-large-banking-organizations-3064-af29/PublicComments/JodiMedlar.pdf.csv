"Through my work at the Montana Depar tment of Commerce, Iâ€™ve seen fi rst-hand how acc"
ess to credit 
"supports various facets of Montana's economy, incl uding its business sector. Gi ven this perspective, I "
am deeply concerned about the Federal Reserve's pr oposed increase in capital requirements for 
"banks. As a committed advocate for ec onomic growth in my state, I ur ge policymakers to thoughtfully "
assess the potential impacts of t he proposal and take measures to safeguard Americans' access to 
the financial resources essential for prosperity. 
"Over the past 15 years, the largest U.S. banks have si gnificantly bolstered their capital and effectively "
sustained the economy and financial system during the recent pandemic and banking challenges. 
"Further, our banks go through stringent stress test s each year to ensure each bank can handle "
economic shocks and continue to support the economy. The proposed increase in banking regul ations is not only unnecessary but  also potentially costly to 
"small business owners. If approved, the rule changes will lead to reduc ed credit availability for all "
"types of lending and undermine economic growth. Sma ll businesses, which often rely on loans to "
"operate and grow, may face challenges in accessing the necessary capital to sustain and expand "
their operations. The Federal Reserve has worked diligently to mitigate the economic fallout from the pandemic and 
help everyday Americans get back on their feet. I urge the Board to continue these efforts and 
implement policies that support the growth and vitality of small businesses across the nation.
