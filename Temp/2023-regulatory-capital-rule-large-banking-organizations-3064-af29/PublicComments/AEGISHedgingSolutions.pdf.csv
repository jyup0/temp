"As outlined by the Coalition for Derivatives End -Users, AEGIS Hedging Solutions  is particularly concerned "
"that Basel III Endgame will have several meaningfully negative effects on our clients, industry, and "
economy. AEGIS Hedging Solutions is a leading commodity risk -management firm representing over 350 
"clients across energy, metals, and environmental markets. We see every day the necessity for "
"transparent, efficient, and regulatory compliant commodity derivative markets.  Financial derivatives "
such as swa ps and options are our clients ’ primary tools for mitigating commodity -price risk. As these 
"derivatives are off ered mostly by banks, our clients  rely on these large financial institutions to provide "
market liquidity.  
 
The largest banking institutions that would be subject to these proposals provide numerous services to 
"clients across the commodity landscape , and these services require offering credit of various types and "
warehousing risk . These large banking organizations play a critical role as counterparties to commercial 
"end users for derivative hedging, serve as capital market intermediaries, and provide sources of capital "
"and lending , among other critical financial roles. The proposals under Basel III Endgame would "
significantly increase the capital requirement and associated costs for these critically important liquidity 
providers. Increased capital costs for banks will undoubtedly result in lower liquidity and higher 
transaction costs to end users of derivative ins truments.  
 
"Not only are these proposals punitive to all derivative end -users, its highly likely smaller businesses will "
be disproportionally adversely affected. Commodity risk mitigation  (most often by “hedging” using 
financial derivatives)  is particularly attractive to small and medium -sized businesses who are increasingly sensitive to commodity -price volatility and unpredictability . Additional barriers to hedging through a 
lack of market liquidity and increased transaction costs could  make it cost prohibitive for some 
businesses to continue this crucial business practice  of hedging .  
 
We urge the Federal Banking Agency to review the current proposal and make appropriate changes in 
accordance with the Coalition for Derivative End -User recommendations.  
 
 
"Sincerely,  "
AEGIS H edging S olutions
