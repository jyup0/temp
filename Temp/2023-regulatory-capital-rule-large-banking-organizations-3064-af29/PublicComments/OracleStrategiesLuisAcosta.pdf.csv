As a sm
"all business owner and proud Latino resident of  Arizona, I write to you in strong opposition to the "
proposed rule changes that would in crease capital requirements for banks in the United States. The proposal 
"would significantly inhibit community mem bers’ ability to secure loans from banks, and would place even more "
limitations on Hispanics’ economic prosperity. 
The proposed changes will have particularly harmfu l effects on credit availability and loans for home 
"ownership, and will disproportionately hurt people of color, especially Hispanics. According to a Politico "
"article, approximately 49 percent of Hispanics own their homes, whereas 75 percent of white  Americans do so. "
Increasing the capital requirements will merely exacerba te these inequities and make homeownership even 
"more unattainable for my community than it already is. The same can be said for our small businesses, that ge nerally rely on banks to keep  growing and investing in "
"their companies and communities. If it becomes more expe nsive to borrow, then many Latino-owned businesses "
will not have access to the financial resources they need to keep their businesses afloat. 
It is important to note that the Federal Reserve has alrea dy helped strengthen big banks to ensure that they could 
"function effectively during and after the COVID-19 pandemic According to Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell, "
"“capital and liquidity levels at our largest, most systemically importa nt banks are at multi-decade highs,” "
meaning that our banks have more than enough cap ital to get us through any potential crisis. 
The Biden administration has also provided the necessary support for small businesses and individuals to thrive 
after the pandemic. It is clear that we must build  upon the policies that saved banks and small businesses 
"throughout the pandemic, and oppose this rule change  that would unnecessarily harm individuals and "
businesses.  --
