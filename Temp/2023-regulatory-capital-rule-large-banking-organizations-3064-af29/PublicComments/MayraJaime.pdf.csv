"Dear FDIC,"
I write to you today as a Latina business owner and Arizona community member to strongly oppose the proposed
"increase in capital requirements for banks. Minority-owned businesses play a crucial role in ensuring that our local,state and national economies are thriving—we must create policies that support these individuals and businesses,rather than implementing rules that will negatively impact lending and borrowing abilities."
The proposed changes to capital requirements would lead to more stringent lending standards and decreased access
"to affordable credit—in doing so, small businesses like mine will have less access to the financial resources andassistance they need to remain open, particularly during this period of economic uncertainty. These newrequirements could similarly disincentivize young entrepreneurs from starting their own businesses and investing intheir goals for fear of not securing the financial aid they need to get their feet off the ground."
It goes without saying that our banks are more than prepared to handle any oncoming crisis. We saw firsthand
"during the COVID-19 pandemic that they helped keep our economy going. Our banks already hold more capitalthan European banks and get annually inspected by the Federal Reserve and if increasing capital requirements willhave negative effects on our communities, then adopting this proposal is unnecessary."
I applaud President Biden and his administration’s work to maintain a strong economy in the face of an
"unprecedented pandemic and the Federal Reserve’s work to battle rising inflation—it is vital, however, that weexpand this work to continuing to help small businesses, and particularly minority-owned businesses that areessential to driving job creation, innovation, and overall economic growth. I urge you to reconsider adoption of thesenew rules and instead invest in the needs of our community and small businesses.Mayra JaimeImagination Tree Learning CenterCEO"
