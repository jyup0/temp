"Good Evening, "
"As the Executive Director of Black Leaders Organizi ng for Communities, I hav e dedicated my life to "
"advocating for the betterment of our communities, particularly those that have historically been "
"marginalized and underserved. Increasing capi tal requirements on banks, without careful "
"consideration of the consequences, woul d only exacerbate existing inequalities. "
"On its face, raising capital requi rements seems like a sound financial action. However, when taking a "
"closer look, we can see that doing so is actually  entirely unnecessary. The fa ct is that our current "
banking system is strong and battle-tested. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell himself has stated 
"so, affirming that “the banking system  is very strong, well-capitalized, highly liquid.” Despite these "
"assurances by the head of the Federal Reserve,  these regulations remain in the pipeline. "
Moving forward with these rules would harm communities  that have historically struggled to obtain 
consistent access to banking services and credit lines . This is especially true for African-American 
"populations in Milwaukee, who have faced decades of r edlining, discriminatory lending practices, and "
"other forms of economic disparitie s. By raising capital requirem ents for banks, these communities "
"would face even tighter lending standards, making it even more difficult fo r them to obtain the "
"financial resources they need to thrive. As outlined by the Urban Institute,  this proposal “would "
"disproportionately disadvantage low-  and moderate-income (LMI) bo rrowers and communities, as "
well as Black and Hispanic borrowers.” 
These regulations would directly impact the African-American community’s ability to build 
"generational wealth. First time homebuyers would struggle to obtain a mortgage from a bank, who "
would now attempt to cut off any  borrower they perceive to be a risky investment. This shuts out 
"countless families from being able to build equity  from owning a home. At  the same time, these "
diminished financial services would lead African-American owned businesses to struggle to obtain the 
"loans they need to meet payroll, pay for rent, and mo re. This would leave them struggling to stay "
afloat financially and could even forc e them to close their doors for good. 
Past policies and rules have made sure our banks ar e better prepared for any financial turbulence 
"that may arise in the future. In li ght of this, there is no real need to  consider regulations to amend a "
"banking system that is working. For this reason, I ur ge you to reject this proposal to ensure we do not "
disproportionately burden African-American communities in Milwaukee and nationwide.
