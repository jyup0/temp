Proposal: Regulatory Capital Rule: Amendments Applicable to Large Banking 
Organizations and to Banking Organizations with Significant Trading Activity [R-1813] / 
Docket ID OCC-2023-0008 / RIN 3064-AF29 
"Dear Chair Powell, Comptroller Hsu, and Chair Gruenberg, "
"As members of the Harris County Homeownership Collaborative in Harris County, TX, we write "
to echo the National Housing Conference’s deep concern about reports that you are considering 
significantly increasing capital standards on some mortgages with down payments of less than 
20%. Please review Docket 
Our Collaborative was founded to increase homeownership rates for residents of Harris County 
"who are Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC), and our respective organizations "
bring deep experience in creating sustainable homeownership for these households. Many of 
"the households we serve use bank-originated mortgages, Special Purpose Credit Programs, "
and other such mortgage loans with down payments of less than 20% to achieve their 
homeownership goals and begin building wealth and long-term housing stability. Here are some 
"key points we can share, based in years of experience working with these households directly: "
● We have not seen substantial differences in the rates of foreclosure or pre-foreclosure 
proceedings based on a household’s loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. 
● We know that a down payment of 20% in today’s economic environment is unreachable 
"for many households, and that higher capital standards on mortgages with down "
payments of less than 20% will have a disproportionately negative impact on the 
availability of mortgages for people of color in Harris County and across the country. ______________ ● We believe that current mortgage insurance requirements already provide an effective 
strategy to mitigate risks for the banking sector. 
"In sum, we believe that these proposed changes to capital standards are misguided and will "
reinforce a legacy of racial inequality in homeownership. We strongly urge your organizations to 
keep risk weighting at 50% for well-underwritten high-LTV loans. 
"Sincerely, "
