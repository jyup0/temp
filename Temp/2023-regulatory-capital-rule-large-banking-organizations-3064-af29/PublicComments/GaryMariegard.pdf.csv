As the President of the Board of  Directors for the Montana Societ y of Public Accountants and the 
"owner of Laser1040, an accounting and financial firm in Helena, MT, I feel  it's essential to express my "
concerns regarding the proposed increase in capital requirements.  
Leaders from the Federal Reserve like Jay Powell hav e confirmed that our banks are well-p
ositioned 
"to weather any recession, with Powell  stating that our capital levels are at “multi-decade highs”. That "
"being said, an increase in capital r equirements is totally unnecessary ri ght now, especially one of this "
caliber. The proposed 20 percent increase in capital requirements s eems somewhat like a knee-jerk 
"reaction, and I worry that it may inadvertently lead to a tightening of credit av ailability, which could "
have far-reaching effects on the broader economy.  
It is imperative to recognize that credit is a vi tal force sustaining our ec onomy. Small and medium-
sized busin
"esses, as well as individual consumer s, rely on access to credi t to facilitate economic "
"growth, create jobs, and stimulat e investments. In a time when our  economy is still recovering from "
"the impacts of recent global events, it is essent ial to balance the need for increased capital buffers "
with the potential consequences of c hoking off the flow of credit.  
"In light of these concerns, I strongly suggest"
 that you oppose this proposal. I appreciate the Federal 
"Reserve's commitment to financial st ability, and I trust that you will carefully consider the potential "
consequences of any changes to capital requirements. It is essential that we work collaboratively to 
"strike the right balance, allowing our economy to thrive while sa feguarding against systemic risks.  "
