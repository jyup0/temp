"Dear reviewer, "
"As managing director of OneMn.org, an organization dedicated to im proving the lives of underserved "
"communities, I believe that raising capital requiremen ts for banks would have detrimental effects on our "
mission and on vulnerable communities in Minnesota.  While I understand the importance of maintaining 
"financial stability, it is crucial to strike a balance that considers the broader socioeconomic implications. "
"Increasing capital requirements for banks may seem like a prudent measure for financ ial stability, but it risks "
exacerbating the economic disparities that already plague our society. The burden of these requirements falls 
"disproportionately on smalle r community banks, which are often the lif eline for underserved and marginalized "
communities.  
"By imposing higher capital requirements, we risk lim iting their ability to extend credit to businesses and "
"individuals who need it the most. Th is could hinder economic growth an d perpetuate inequality, directly "
contradicting our goal of closing economic gaps and fostering inclusive economic development. 
"By working together to foster inclus ive economic growth and stability, we can build a brighter future for all "
"Americans, especially those who have been historically marginalized and underserved, but we cannot do that if "
proposals like this one add to the burd en that underserved communities face. 
"In continued service, Brett Buckner, Managing Director OneMn.org "
