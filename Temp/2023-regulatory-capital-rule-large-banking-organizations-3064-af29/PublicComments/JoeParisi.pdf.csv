"November 16, 2023 Dear  Chair Powell and Chair Gruenberg:  "
I am writing to urge you not to significantly increase capital standards on some mortgages with down 
payments of less than 20 percent. This policy change will hurt many first- time home buyers in Dane 
County who are already facing steep mortgage interest rates and high housing prices resulting from a shortage of available housing in our fast -growing county. Putting another hurdle in front of 
homeownership for first -time homebuyers will lock too many people out of the best way to build 
wealth for years to come.  
 Low- and moderate -income people already face significant barriers buying a home in Dane County. 
"The median price for a Dane County home is now around $400,000, which is a sig nificant jump from "
just a few years ago. Many Black and Latino families in our area do not have the advantage of multi -
generational wealth to take into this very competitive housing market as they try to become first- time 
"homebuyers. Given all we know about the gaps in homeowership that already exist between White households and Black and Latino households , it would counterproductive  for your agencies  to start "
enacting new  barriers to for first -time homebuyers . 
 Dane County has been working for years to bui ld partnerships addressing housing access and 
"affordability, especially among racial and ethnic minorities. We commissioned a housing assessment in 2019 that found disparities in homeownership rates for racial and ethnic minorities even when they have the same income rates as a White household. This no doubt is the result of generations of housing discrimination, which is why government entities at every level should strive to ensure policy changes donâ€™t compound the racial disparities already in our housing systems.   Homeownership is one of the best ways for families to build wealth and I urge you not put this out of "
reach for more families by making it more expensive for banks to lend to first -time homebuyers. 
  
" Sincerely,  "
J
oe Parisi  
Dane County Executive
