"Dear FDIC, I write to express m"
y opposition to the proposal that would requi re banks to increase their capital 
"requirements. The proposed requirements would have a si gnificant impact on people and businesses of color, "
and particularly Hispanics in the United States. Di scriminatory credit and hous ing policies have long had 
"harmful consequences for Hispanic communities, leav ing them disproportionately less likely to receive "
mortgages or to afford owning their homes. Accordi ng to a report from the Center for Responsible Lending 
"(CRL), it would take 11 years for Hisp anic/Latino renters in their median income to earn enough funds to afford "
"a five percent down payment on a medi an-priced home; conversely, white re nters on average only need nine "
"years to afford a five percent down payment. Furthermore, businesses of color already face significant hardships "
in accessing affordable credit and the proposed requireme nts will make it even more difficult to do so. Access 
"to credit is a key component for creating a thriving sm all business, and limiting minority business owners' and "
families’ ability to receive loans and credit lines will undermine any attempts to close th e racial wealth gap. I 
"would also like to bring to your atte ntion that after th e 2008 crisis, leaders and federa l regulators worked to pass "
"the Dodd-Frank Act that has greatly strengthened our banking system. In June 2023, the Federal Reserve stated "
"that our banks are “well positioned to w eather a severe recession and continue to lend to households,” which we "
"witnessed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through the financial stress caused by the pandemic, the Biden administration has taken significant m easures to bolster small businesses and advance economic equity, while "
the Federal Reserve has diligently worked to curb the infla tionary pressures that plagued us in the previous year. 
Passing this proposal would interfere with the work our leaders have b een doing to improve our economy. I 
implore you to reconsider these proposed requirements and invest in an economy that works for all people in the 
"United States. Thank you, Richard Es trada Arizona Community Leader "
