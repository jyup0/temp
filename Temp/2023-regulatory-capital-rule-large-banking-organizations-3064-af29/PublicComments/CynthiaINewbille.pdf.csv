Dear Sir or Madam
: 
The recently introduced regulation to increase capital re quirements for banks appears to worsen the economic 
"outlook for Black families across Richmond, making it more difficult to maintain a business or buy a home. To "
"truly protect our communities of color, I re quest that you reject th is proposed regulation. "
"Under this rule, banks would be required by federal la w to hold a higher amount of  capital in their reserves. "
"This threatens to create a major credit pinch, as banks w ould be less inclined to give  out loans. Doing so would "
directly harm Black businesses here in  Central Virginia that rely on rapid access to these financial services. By 
"making it harder to consistently acc ess credit, they would struggle to  fund everyday nece ssities for their "
"operations. With one of the highest ra tes of Black owned businesses in th e entire country, we cannot leave a "
critical portion of our region’s economy behind. 
Small businesses aren’t the only area that will feel  economically strained under increased banks capital 
"requirements. First time homebuyers would struggle to obtain  a mortgage if we move to  enact this regulation, as "
loans would be both more expensive and scarce for approved borrowers. Th is would especially harm Black 
"families in search of their first home, who have already had to combat housing policies that discriminate against "
"them for years on end, preventing them from building ge nerational wealth. Now, by finalizing this rule, we "
would only worsen the already historically bad h ousing affordability crisis our nation is facing. 
"Over the last few years, the Biden- Harris administration has continued to create an equitable society for Black "
families across the country. We must ensure that we con tinue this progress by voting against the regulation to 
"increase bank capital requirements. Again, your review and reje ction of this proposed regulation is requested. "
"Sincerely, "
", Councilmember "
"Richmond City Council, Richmond East End 7th Voter District "
