To Whom it May Concern -
I am writing to express my concerns about the proposed bank regulatory c apital requirements that 
threaten to derail the clean ener gy transition and urge the FDIC to oppose this proposal. 
Our country is at a crucial moment in history where we can finally look  to confront climate change and 
"the damaging effects it has had on our planet. Specifically, key pieces of legislation at the state and "
federal level have accrued the money to develop r enewable energy sources t hat will help put us on 
"the path of being carbon neut ral. However, this progress could be stymied if an unnecessary "
regulation that seeks to raise capital r equirements for banks is put into place. 
"As the former Executive Direc tor of the Nevada Conservations League, I have seen legislative "
momentum - from local government to  the federal level - in efforts to combat the impact of climate 
"change. At the state level, this has included over a million dollars invested towards helping fight "
"drought and climate change through cloud seeding. At t he federal level, we have seen billions of "
"dollars doled out to states that seek to advance clean energy projects, bol stering our economy with "
good paying jobs. 
These efforts could all be for naught should we move forward with implementing higher capital 
"requirements on our financial institutions. A majority of climate pr ojects are run by small developers, "
"who look to banks to obtain the capital they need to get them started. However, this strategy could "
"cease to exist under new regulations, as banks become more conservative in who they provide loans "
"to. This would leave many projects at an impasse , as they lack the funding to move forward, and "
prevent them from being complet ed in a quick and efficient manner. 
The surprising thing about this proposal is that  many of our country’s  leading economists and 
financial advisors have indicated that raising bank capital requirements is an unnecessary step that 
"would do more harm than good. U.S. banks are already “very strong, well-capitalized, [and] highly "
"liquid” according to Federal Reserve Chairm an Jermoe Powell, making additional regulation "
redundant. 
Our federal leaders clearly understand that now is the time to turn the tide against climate change. 
"While their efforts are appreciated and acknowledged, they could be a dr op in the bucket if we decide "
"to increase capital requirements on banks. To ensure we can properly fight climate change and heal our planet, I urge you to oppose this proposal. "
"Thank you, "
