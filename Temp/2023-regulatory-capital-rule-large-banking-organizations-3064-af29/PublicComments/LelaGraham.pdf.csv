Subject: [EXTERNAL MESSAGE] Docket Number: R-1813/RIN: 7100-AG64
I am writing to express my deep c oncerns about the potentia l impact of raising capital requirements 
on homeownership in Montana and nat ionwide. As a former Democr atic Legislative candidate and 
"local democratic activist, I have always advocated for policies that promot e affordable housing and "
economic stability for working-cla
"ss Americans. In light  of this, I urge you to carefully consider the "
consequences of any decision to raise capi tal requirements for fi nancial institutions.  
"I personally experienced many challenges as a first-time ho mebuyer in Great Falls, especially in today's difficul t"
"real estate and lending environment. Homeownership is a fundamental part of the American dream, providing "
"financial security, stability, and a se nse of pride. However, for many, this  dream remains out of reach without "
the assistance of mortgage loans. 
Raising capital requirements for banks and lending institutions would exacerbate the hurdles that prospective 
homebuyers must overcome. Higher capit al requirements would make banks less likely to extend credit to 
individuals with less-than-perf ect credit scores or limited down payment resources. This could 
disproportionately affect first-time homebuyers and those with lower incomes. 
"When financial institutions are required  to hold more capital in reserve, th ey may pass on the increased costs to "
borrowers in the form of higher interest rates and fees . This would make homeownership even less affordable 
"for many aspiring buyers. While I understand the importance of fina ncial stability and the need to prot ect against systemic risks, I also "
know that our banks are fully prepared to handle any pot ential crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic was a real life 
"stress test, in which our banks were able to support our economy. The Federa l Reserve has even stated that our "
banks are “are well positioned to weather a se vere recession” should it come down to that. 
"Thank you for taking into account the voices of those who may be affected by these decisions, and I hope that "
you will prioritize policies that promote financial inclus ion and homeownership opportunities for all Americans.
