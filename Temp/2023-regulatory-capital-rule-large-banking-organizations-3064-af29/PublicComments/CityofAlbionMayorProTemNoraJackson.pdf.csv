I am writing to express my deep concerns regarding the proposed increase in capital 
"requirements and its potential impact on small businesses, both in Michigan and "
"nationwide. As the council member  representing Precinct 3 in Albion, Michigan, I believe it "
is crucial to voice my apprehensions about policies that may hinder the growth and success of our local entrepreneurs. 
"Increasing capital requirements can have a detrimental effect on our small businesses, "
particularly during these challenging economic times. It's essential to recognize that small 
businesses are the lifeblood of our communi ty and the backbone of our national 
"economy. They provide jobs, drive innovation, and foster a sense of local identity. While "
"many small businesses suffered as a result of  the pandemic, the Biden administration has "
fortunately worked to help them recover. 
Raising capital requirements for financial instit utions could make it more difficult for these 
"businesses to secure the loans and financial su pport they need to th rive, especially when "
"they are still rebuilding. Small business owners  have the vision, determination, and passion "
to create economic opportunities and prosperi ty within our region. We must not stifle 
their potential for growth by imposing overly  burdensome capital requirements on banks. 
It is worth mentioning that our banks are “w ell positioned to weather a severe recession” 
"as stated by the Federal Reserve Board in Ju ne 2023. Additionally, our banks have proven "
"themselves to be ready to help during any cris is that should occur, given that each year "
they have to pass stress tests to show their ability to support the economy should we face 
another downfall. 
I urge you to consider the potential consequences  of this proposed polic y on the vitality of 
"small businesses in Michigan and across the nation. Rather than hindering their growth, "
"we should be exploring ways to support and empower these businesses, especially in the "
2face of economic challenges. I applaud the Fe deral Reserve’s work in  combating inflation 
and hope to see policymakers and regulators  continue to promote policies that will 
improve our economy as a whole.
