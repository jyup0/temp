  My fa
mily has raised cattle here in South Carolina  for four generations. It’s a source of pride that has 
"motivated me to not only continue  the work of those who came before  me, but also to speak up for our "
"farming community, which has had its share of ups and downs over the years. It motivated me to run for "
"public office, where I served on the Sumter County Council to speak up for our rural neighbors and tend "
to their needs. 
"Many of our region’s farmers are now worried about the proposal to have banks raise the amount of capital they hold in their reserves. This action will have  adverse effects on our ability to secure loans, as "
banks would look to shrink their portfolios by denying any borrowers they view as risky. Without this 
"access to credit, farmers won’t have the money th ey need to fund their operations, purchase new "
"agricultural equipment, or pay their workers. These barriers could then lead to slow downs in agricultural "
"production. With agribusiness being our largest i ndustry, accounting for nearly 260,000 jobs and $52 "
"billion in annual economic impact, this action w ould have major consequences on our state’s food "
"security and economy. Whatmore is that making banks hold on to more capital in their reserves is not necessary, as we already "
"have a robust financial sector. Federal Reserve Chairm an Jerome Powell has indi cated this, stating that "
"“the banking system is very st rong, well-capitalized, [and] highly liq uid.” With these banks already "
"upheld to the highest standards.  in the world and required to pass econo mic stress tests to ensure stability, "
there is virtually no real need to mandate even hi gher capital requirements on a system that is working 
"just fine. The Federal Reserve has shown leadersh ip in their fight against inflation, with recent data showing we are "
on the verge of finally returning to normal levels. This has allowed fa rmers across South Carolina to get 
back on their track and on stable economic footing. He lp us make sure things stay this way by saying no 
to higher capital requirements that simply arent necessary.
