"Dear FDIC, "
As a Latina involved with policy for th e greater part of m
"y life, now CE O of Latina Chamber of Commerce in "
Arizona. I am reaching out in opposition to the proposal that would require  banks to increase their capital 
requirements. The proposed requirements would have a major impact on people and particularly small 
"businesses, and minorities especially the Hispanic population in the United States. "
I am concerned the proposed requirement will open it up to discriminatory credit and housing policies that have 
long had harmful consequences for Hispanic communities.  I have lived long enough to see the negative impact 
the discriminatory policies had on the possibilities fo r upward mobility for Latinos. These harmful policies 
made it more difficult to access mortgages or the dream of being a homeowner. A report from the Center for 
"Responsible Lending (CRL), says it would take 11 years fo r Hispanic/Latino renters in  their median income to "
earn enough funds to afford a five percent down payment on a median-priced home; in comparison to white 
renters on average only need nine years to afford a fi ve percent down payment. This is problematic and we 
cannot leave the majority of this country behind. 
Minority owned businesses face significant hurdles when trying to access affordable credit and the requirements 
being proposed will make it even more difficult. Access to  credit is instrumental for becoming entrepreneurs. 
The possibility of the proposed legislation poses a real  threat and limits not just  the possible business but 
business but the entire family’s ability to receive lo ans and credit lines. We cannot  address the racial and 
economic opportunity wealth gap. The pandemic caused enough financial strain and stre ss. I commend President Biden's administration for 
making the advancement of economic equity a priority th rough the small business initiatives while the Federal 
Reserve has diligently worked to curb the inflationary pressures we have seen. I ask for your consideration to 
work on policies that address the economic equity gap and reject the proposed regulations on banking that will make economic advancement more difficult. 
"Respectfully, "
Ana Valenzuela Estrada
