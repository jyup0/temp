Re:  Request for Re -Proposal of Regulatory Capital Rule to Remedy Administrative Procedure Act 
Violations (Federal Reserve Docket No. R -1813 ; FDIC RIN 3064 -AF29; Docket ID OCC -2023 -0008)  
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:   
  
"The Bank Policy Institute , the American Bankers Associati on, the Financial Services Forum , the "
"Institute of International Bankers,  the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association  and the U.S. "
Chamber of Commerce1 are writin g with respect to the joint proposed rulemaking amending the capital 
requirements applicable to large banking organizations.  The proposed regulations would significantly 
"increase capital requirements for larger banks.  Yet in support of these substantial  new requirements , the "
proposed rule repeatedly relies on data and analys es that the agencies have not made available to the 
 
1 See Appendix for more information on the Associations.  -2- 
public.2  This reliance on non-public  information violates clear requirements under the Administrative 
Procedure Act that agencies must publicly disclose the data and analys es on which their rulemaking is 
"based.  To remedy this violation, t he agencies must make available the various types of missing material "
identified below —along with any and all other evidence and analyses the agenc ies relied on in proposing 
the rule —and re -propose the rule .  To remain  consistent with what the agencies themselves have 
"determined to be an “appropriate” commen t period, the agencies should provide for a new 120 -day "
"comment period in the re -proposal .3  Absent a formal re -proposal, and a t a minimum , the agencies must "
extend the comment period to no sooner than 120 days after the date on which the agencies disclose all 
necessary information.   
"As part of the APA’s notice -and-comment requirements, a ll agencies have  the “duty to identify "
and make available technical studies and data that [they] ha[ve] employed in reaching the decisions to 
propose particular rules.”4  Agencies  “must explain the assumptions and methodology” underlying a 
"proposed rule “and, if the meth odology is challenged, must provide a complete analytic defense.”5  And, "
"where an agency omits some of the “critical factual material” and analys es from a proposed rule, it must "
"disclose the material and then provide “further opportunity to comment.”6  Indeed, “[a]n agency commits "
serious procedural error when it fails to reveal portions of the technical basis for a proposed rule in time 
to allow for meaningful commentary.”7 
The proposed rule violates these basic legal obligations .  Key elements of the proposed rule rely 
"on a wide variety of data, analyses and methodologies that have been withheld from public view and "
comment.  For example:  
• To select a multiplier of “15” in one element of the proposed rule’s internal loss multiplier 
"formula for operational risk, the proposed rule “extrapolates from average annual total net "
"operational losses the potential for unusually large losses,” in an apparent effort to “ensure” that "
banks “maintain[] sufficient capital.”8  But the proposed rule d oes not disclose to the public any 
"analys es supporting a multiplier of “15,” nor does it reveal what the agencies mean by “sufficient” "
and how they came to the conclusion that a multiplier of “15” would result in “sufficient” capital.  
 
2 FDIC Director McKernan noted this point in his dissent from the proposed rule.  See Statement by Jonathan

"• The proposed rule wo uld include “minimum haircut floors ,” which are  calibrat ed based on "
“observed historical price volatilities as well as existing market and central bank haircut 
conventions.”9  These underlying data and analyses have not been made available to the public.10 
 
• The proposed rule increases the “supervisory parameter p for securitizations that are not 
resecuritization exposures from 0.5 to 1.0 ” to offse t the decrease in “risk weights applicable to 
certain underlying assets under the proposal . . . and the propos ed reduction in the risk -weight 
floor under SEC -SA for securitization exposures that are not resecuritization exposures.”11  No 
analys is used to calibrate the increase in the “ p” parameter  to offset the decrease in credit risk 
weights has been made availab le to the public.  
 
• The proposed rule states that “[p]urchased credit protection through nth -to-default derivatives 
often does not correlate with the hedged exposure which inhibits the risk mitigating benefits of 
the instrument.”12  No data  or analysis unde rlying this assertion has been made available to the 
public.  
 
• The proposed rule would scale the capital requirement under the basic credit valuation method 
used to calculat e the capital charge for credit valuation adjustment risk “by a factor of 0.65” to 
“ensure” that the basic approach “is calibrated appropriately relative to the” standardized 
"approach.”13  Neither the analysis justifying the 0.65 factor, nor any explanation  for what the "
"agencies deem “appropriate[]” calibration, has been publicly released.  "
 
"In addition, the proposed rule repeatedly relies on non -public analyses that are said to arise from "
"the agencies’ “supervisory experience” to justify various elements of the proposed rule.  For example, to "
justify using lower real estate valuations for purposes of calculating loan -to-value ratios (thereby resulting 
"in higher risk weights), the proposed rule states that “[s]upervisory experience has shown that m arket "
values of real estate properties can be temporarily impacted by local market forces and using a value 
"figure including such volatility would not reflect the long -term value of the real estate.”14  Similarly, the "
proposed rule relies on “experience” f or the proposition that “operational risk is inherent in all banking

"10 In this instance, the reliance on nonpublic supervisory experience at all is particularly puzzling, as public data is "
"readily available that could be used to justify volatility assumptions in securities’ values, and central bank haircut "
conventions are av ailable on public websites.

"products, activities, processes, and systems,”15 an assertion which is fundamental to the imposition of an "
"entirely new operational risk capital charge on many banks.  At a minimum, the a gencies must disclose "
the specific data supporting their calibration of operational risk and demonstrate that the operational risk 
component and other elements of the proposed rule do not impose duplicative capital charges.  The 
"proposed rule also relies o n “supervisory experience” for narrow issues, such as to justify applying higher "
"risk weights to acquisition, development and construction loans (“ADC”)16 than to other categories of real "
estate loans.17  Neither these analyses nor any specifics of the age ncies’ “supervisory experience” have 
been made available to the public.  
We recognize that some of the data and analyses referenced above may raise confidentiality 
"concerns; however, nothing prevents the agencies from releasing such data and analyses in a manner that "
is anonymized or aggregated to the extent necessary to protect bank or other party confidentiality.  But 
the agencies must either do so or refrain from relying on the data and related analyses in support of their 
proposed rule.  
"This list above is merely illustrative, not exhaustive.  Furthermore, it does not include many other "
"instances in the proposed  rule where the agencies simply assert a proposition with no citation, evidence "
or analysis to back it up.  For example:  
• In order to  justify a requirement that a corporate borrower or its parent company have securities 
outstanding that are publicly traded in order for its exposures to qualify for a preferential 
"“investment -grade” risk weight, t he proposal flatly asserts with no data  or explanation  that "
“publicly -traded corporate entities are subject to enhanced transparency and market discipline 
"as a result of being listed publicly on an exchange.”18  Presumably, the agencies  have concluded  "
that company disclosures under the Securities Exchange Act of 193 4 create this transparency and 
"market discipline , but they do not explicitly state as much, nor do they make any attempt to tie "
"these qualities  to improved creditworthiness  vis-à-vis unlisted borrowers , such that only publicly "
listed companies should qualify for the preferential risk weight . 
 
• The proposal also posits without support that “proposed correlation parameters are sufficiently 
conservative to appropriately capture the potential interactions between risk factors that the 
market risk covered positions may experience in a time of stress.”19   
 
• The calculation of the capital requirement for non -modellable risk factors in the market risk rule 
"includes a supervisory p factor of “0.6,” the calibration of which is nowhere explained or "
 
"15 Id. at 185 (“Experience shows that operational risk is inherent in all banking products, activities, processes, and "
systems.”).  
 
"16 An ADC exposure is an exposure secured by  real estate  for the purpose  of acquiring,  developing  or constructing  "
"residential  or commercial real  estate  properties,  as well as all land -development  loans  and all other  land  loans.  "
 
17 Id. at 79 (“[S]upervisory  experience has shown that ADC exposures have heightened risk compared to permanent 
"commercial real estate exposures.”); see also, e.g. , id. at 96 (asserting that “supervisory experience suggests that "
obligors similar to those with charge cards have averag e credit utilization rates equal to approximately 10 percent”).

"justified.20  Instead, the proposal simply asserts that the calculation “ would  allow  for a limited "
and appropriate diversification benefit that depends on the level of p parameter.”21 
 
"In some cases, the agencies do not even assert a proposition, and instead simply propose "
"calibrations with no justification or explanation at all.  For example, the proposed market risk rule would "
apply a multiplier of between 1.5 and 2 to modeled requirem ents based on a firm’s number of backtesting 
"exceptions, but the proposal provides no justification or explanation for the calibration of this range of "
multipliers.22  The proposal’s deficiency in this respect extends to matters as fundamental and basic as the 
choice of the various new risk weights proposed in the revised credit -risk framework.  It is not possible for 
"any commenter to tell whether these risk weights were chosen arbitrarily, with no underlying data to "
"support the calibrations, or whe ther they are based on specific supporting data or other evidence that "
"has not been made available to the public; in either case, the proposal is fatally flawed.   "
There is one  exception from this absolute lack of explanation  of the calibration of credit risk 
weights : the proposal indicates that it raised the risk weights for residential real estate and retail credit 
exposures above the risk weights agreed to in the Basel standard in an “attempt[] to mitigate potential 
"competitive  effects between U.S. banking organizations .”23  It goes on to note that, absent the adjustment, "
“marginal funding costs on residential real estate and retail credit exposures for many large banking 
organizations could  have been substantially lower than fo r smaller organizations not subject to the 
"proposal ,” thereby potentially making smaller banks less competitive in this area.24  Without agreeing or "
disagreeing that  the competitiveness of small banks is a legitimate consideration for the calibration  of 
"credit risk weights , like the other instances of naked assertions noted above, the agencies provide no "
analysis that actually assesses  the projected relative marginal funding costs of larger versus smaller banks.  
The agencies are required by basic principles of administrative law to make this missing material —and 
"any other evidence , analys es or methodologies underlying the proposed rule —available to commenters.  "
"In addition to the information that the agencies omitted from the proposed rule, the agencies "
have also acknowledged that they plan to “collect additional data to refine [their] estima tes of the rule’s 
"effects” during the comment period, which will “inform finalization of the rule.”25  Collecting such data "
"during, rather than before, the comment period is also legally improper —the purpose of the comment "
"period is for the public to revie w the agency’s proposal, including any supporting evidence, not for the "
agency to finish doing work that should have been completed before issuing the proposal.  The agencies

"cannot fill in the blanks in the final rule.26  Instead, to the extent the agenci es intend to collect and analyze "
"further data on which to base some or all of their rulemaking in this area, they must suspend the current "
"open rulemaking, complete any data collection and analysis necessary to support their crafting and "
"calibration of the  rule, re -propose the rule in light of the additional analyses and data  and make that "
information available to the public and then allow commenters an opportunity to respond.  Any other 
approach would violate the agencies’ duty to identify and make availab le for public review and comment 
"the technical studies and data on which any rule is based.   As noted above, anonymizing or aggregating "
data can address confidentiality concerns and still allow the agencies to meet their legal obligations.  
"Because of the critical  procedural deficiencies describe d above, neither we nor other commenters "
"are able to fully and properly comment on the proposal at this time.  Accordingly, we request that the "
agencies make available the various types of missing mat erial identified above —along with any and all 
other evidence and analyses the agenc ies relied on in proposing the rule —and re -propose the rule with a 
new comment period.27  If the agencies are unwilling to  re-propose the rule along with a complete 
"evidenti ary record in compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act then , at minimum , the agencies "
should extend the comment period to no sooner than 120 days after the date on which all necessary 
"information is disclosed, including the agencies’ ongoing analyses of the impact of the proposed rule.   Our "
"request  is not just that the agencies “play by the rules,” although a failure to do so should alone be "
"sufficient to justify that request.  Rather, this is a rule of sweeping impact and it is not only essen tial for "
"our members, but also in the national interest, that the new requirements be adopted only after the public "
has a meaningful opportunity to scrutinize both the proposal and the underlying rationale.
