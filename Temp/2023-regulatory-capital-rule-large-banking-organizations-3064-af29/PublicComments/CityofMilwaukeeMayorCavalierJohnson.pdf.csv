To whom it may concern:  
 
"Milwaukee , like cities around the country, continues to deal with the economic effects of the global "
COVID -19 pandemic . Inflation and r ising interest rates  create barriers to economic security and 
wealth -building for working - and middle -class households.  I am concerned that the effort to raise 
capital requirements could reinforce or  worsen those barriers  – espec ially for households of color 
aspiring to own a home.  
 
Homeownership has long remained the primary mechanism for accumulating and passing on 
wealth in American society. This is particularly true for those in lower economic strata who have 
few opportunities for investment.  Sustained homeownership is a primary mechanism for class 
"mobility, bringing families into the middle class and allowing parents to pass a more advantaged "
economic s tatus on to their children.  A lack of sustained homeownership disadvantages lower -
"income communities, particularly communities of color, leaving large swaths of the community  "
"with little to no wealth to pass on to younger generations, functionally trapping people at a lower "
"economic level.  Consequently, racial disparity in homeownership is a key contributor to racial "
wealth disparities.  
 
"As a mayor,  I prioritize increasing homeownership  in my city as a mechanism for improving the "
lives of my constituents and buil ding strong neighborhoods. In addition to building generational 
"wealth, h omeownership is associated with behaviors related to neighborhood stability, satisfaction, "
"and strength. For example,  homeowners are much more likely than renters to participate in "
"neighborhood associations, civic groups, and to vote in local elections .  "
I am concerned that this  new bank rule will be harmful to  first time homebuyers in Milwaukee. 
Enforcing higher capital reserve requirements may cause banks to limit the number of mortgages 
offered and make mortgages more expensive for borrowers. This would make it harder than ever 
to purchase a home  at a time when prospective homebuyers are already facing high prices and 
"interest rates.  People of color , who have historically faced greater barriers in mortgage lending "
"than white buy ers, would likely be most affected by these changes .  "
"Furthermore, Urban Institute performed an independent analysis of the proposed changes in "
September 2023 and issued a report  stating:  
 
“There is no logical argument for the bank capital requirements proposed in the NPR. They 
are much higher than the Basel requirements. And our analysis shows they are higher than 
a repeat of the 2005 –08 experience would suggest is necessary to protect the financial  
 
" system. … We have shown that LMI borrowers, LMI communities, and Black and "
"Hispanic borrowers are disproportionately represented in the highest LTV categories, the "
categories targeted to see increases in the capital requirements. This will translate direct ly 
into higher costs for these borrowers. … This proposal also goes against the recent 
"guidance by the bank regulators and other government agencies, including the Consumer "
"Financial Protection Bureau and the US Department of Housing and Urban Development,  "
to encourage lenders to design special purpose credit programs to increase the amount of 
"home mortgage lending to those underserved groups. In short, the level of capital that banks "
"would be required by the NPR to hold against mortgage loans held in portf olio is excessive, "
"at all LTV levels, and is likely to further discourage bank mortgage lending. The NPR’s "
impact on lending to LMI borrowers and communities and to borrowers of color is 
particularly perverse in the face of efforts by the bank regulators a nd other government 
agencies to encourage banks to increase their lending to precisely these borrowers and 
communities. ” 
 
"Therefore, I encourage officials to reconsider the proposal.  "
 
"Sincerely,  "
Mayor Cavalier Johnson
