"Good day , "
"As someone who started their small businesses from the bottom up, I understand how tough "
"it can be to make ends meet. This was especially true during the COVID -19 pandemic, in "
"which countless businesses had to close their doors. While the inflation crisis we faced shortly after has managed to subside, many of us are still reeling from the economic downturn it created.  "
I now reach out to you because I am ver y worried about the future of small businesses in 
"Virginia and the country if we move forward with a recently introduced bank regulation. Specifically, this rule seeks to increase the amount of capital that banks must hold. Even though such a change may so und reasonable, the reality is that this regulation would create "
"a credit squeeze that small businesses cannot afford. With banks compelled to hold more money in reserve, this would lead them to diminish the number of loans and credit they make available t o small businesses. So many of these companies need access to quick "
"financing so they can pay employees and invest in expansion. Without it, they would be left wondering how to fund their daily operations.  "
Such a drastic reduction in credit access would ha ve dire consequences on businesses of 
"color. Already, studies have shown that 60% of Black businesses owners struggle to obtain sufficient capital to fund their operations. 30% of Latino businesses owners also face the "
"same issue. Now, by increasing capital requirements, this access to funding would get even  "
"worse, putting these businesses of color on the brink of having to let go of employees or "
even close altogether.

The leadership of the Biden administration has certainly helped overcome the economic 
"downturn we saw heading out of the COVID -19 pandemic. Now, I ask that you please vote "
down this rule to protect businesses of color just as theyâ€™re on the verge of making an economic comeback.  
 
Best.
