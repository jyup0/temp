Subject: [EXTERNAL MESSAGE] Docket Number: R-1813 RIN: 7100-AG64   RIN: 3064-AF29
"As a longtime housing rights advocate, I am very concern ed ab out the unintended consequences that increased bank "
capital requirements could have on our communities here in the Tar Heel State.  As the Ho using Chair of the Durham 
"Committee on the Affairs of Black People,  I can attest that this policy does not align with our goals to increase access to "
"low-income and affordable housing, combat housing discrimina tion and eliminate restrictive housing practices and lending "
practices.  Moving forward with this unnecessary regulation could make it harder for families to buy a home when housing 
affordability is already at its lowest level since 1984.  
" Homeownership has been the hallmark of the American drea m for decades. However, by mandating higher capital "
"requirements from our nation’s regulated lending institutions, we could be cutting millions of first-time homebuyers from "
the ability to purchase their dream homes. These rules could make banks more sele ctive in who they provide loans to. 
"This could directly harm homebuyers who aren’t able to put 20%  down, and who are unfairly vi ewed as risky borrowers in "
"the eyes of the bank. As a result, such  regulation could reduce credit availab ility for first-time, low-income mortgage "
borrowers and lock them out of the housing market for years.  
" The impact of these increased capital requirements could es pecially impact communities of color, who have already "
struggled to own their first home due to historical and ongoing  discriminatory housing policies. A study conducted by the 
Center for Responsible Lending has already found that it woul d take Black renter households 14 years to acquire enough 
"funds to afford a 5% down payment for the average home, 5 years longer than their White counterparts. With housing "
"prices recently skyrocketing in just a short period of time , these years can be the difference between building generational "
wealth and remaining a renter.  
" I appreciate the work that the Biden-Harri s administration has done to promote equitable housing policies. Even so, I fear "
that moving forward with increased capital requirements fo r banks would undermine the good work our government’s 
leaders have done up to this point. We must re-assess these on erous regulations and ensure we all work together to help 
"all American families, including low-wealth and minority families, achieve homeownership.  "
