"My name is Jim Smith, and I am wr iting to express my strong oppositi on to the proposed increase in "
"capital requirements for banks. I served as Mayor of Helena, Montana for 17 y ears, where I  closely "
"observed economic development and stability. Because of  this, I believe that such a move could have "
detrimental consequences for our co mmunity and our country as a whole. 
I want to emphasize that our banking system has co me a long way in terms of strengthening its 
resilience since the financial crisis of 2008. Mu ch of this progress can be attributed to the 
implementation of the Dodd-Frank  Wall Street Reform and Consumer  Protection Act during the 
Obama administration. The Dodd-Frank Act intr oduced crucial regulations and safeguards that 
significantly improved the stability and acc ountability of our financial institutions. 
"Under Dodd-Frank, banks have been subjected to rigorous stress tests, enhanced risk management "
"practices, and increased transparency in their operat ions. These measures have ensured that our "
banks are better prepared to weather financial crises and protect the interests of depositors and the 
broader community. 
"Given the effective regulatory framework already in  place, I firmly believe that increasing capital "
requirements is not necessary and frankly could negat ively stifle economic growth. Excessive capital 
"requirements can limit the availabi lity of credit, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, "
which are the lifeblood of our eco nomy. Small businesses often rely on bank loans and credit lines to 
"finance their operations, invest in  growth, and create jobs. Here in  Helena, we rely heavily on our "
small businesses and I urge you to consider t he damage that this proposal would do to our 
"community. Jim Smith Helena, MT "
