Subject: [EXTERNAL MESSAGE] Bank Regulation RIN: 3064-AF29 
I urge you and your colleagues to oppose recent proposals to increase bank capital requirements. At a time 
"when banks, elected officials, and others are attemp ting to address the gap in homeownership in minority "
"communities, this proposal to increase capital requi rements on banks would hinder any continued growth. "
Raising capital requirements without a ddressing the systemic issues that affect African-American communities 
"could further limit access to affordable housing options, perpetuating housing dispariti es and hindering wealth "
accumulation. 
"Historically, black individuals and communities have f aced systemic barriers to accessing mortgage credit. "
"Raising capital requirements for banks may lead to tighter lending standards, making it even more challenging "
"for black homebuyers to secure loan s, especially in neighborhoods that are already underserved. The NAACP "
"signed on to a letter along with othe r major organizations that was sent to the FDIC, OCC, and the Federal "
Reserve in which they indicated that it would take Black renter households at their median in come 14 years to 
"save enough money to put down a 5% downpayment on a home, in comparison to 9 years for White renter "
households. Adopting this proposal would mean Black  Americans would be more disadvantaged when 
becoming homeowners. 
A decision on this proposal can only be made by fully acknowledging and consider ing how much more these 
gaps will be exacerbated if implemented.  
"Sincerely, "
M.T. Pyatt
