I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed incr eas
e in capital requirements on 
"banks. As a personal investor in real estate, I have witnessed firsthand the importance of working "
families' access to capital in achieving their dreams of homeownership and financial stability. 
Increasing capital requirements on banks would hav e detrimental consequences for these families 
and for our economy as a whole.  
"Homeownership provides stability, a sense of belonging, and an opportunity  to build wealth over time. "
"However, for many working families, achieving this dream requires access to affordable mortgage loans. Banks "
play a crucial role in making homeownership a reality for countless individuals and families by providing them 
"with the necessary capital. By increasing capital requi rements on banks, we risk making homeownership out of "
reach for those who need it most. 
Higher capital requirements would lik ely lead to banks tightening thei r lending standards and reducing the 
"availability of mortgage loans. Working families, part icularly those with lower incomes or imperfect credit "
"histories, would find it incr easingly difficult to secure financing for their homes. "
"As the Federal Reserve continues to battle inflation, it is important that proposals, such as this one, do not "
interfere with any progress that has been made. I hope  that you will take into account the importance of 
affordable access to capital for working families and the broader implications for our economy when making 
decisions regarding capital requirements.
