"My name is Danny Nelson, and I am a Director at PFM Asset Management LLC (""PFMAM"").  At PFMAM, I "
"work to assist municipal governments, school distri cts, and other public authorities in managing their "
investments and implementing sound financ ial strategies to secure their fis cal futures. I am writing to express 
my concerns about the potential negative impacts that raising capital requirements on banks could have on our 
clients and the communities they serve. 
"While we recognize the importance of maintaining a robust and stable banki ng system, raising requirements is "
"just not necessary. Our banks have more than enough capital, with Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell "
"confirming that “our largest, most systemically important banks are at multi-decade highs” in capital and "
liquidity levels. 
An increase in capital requirements may be detrimental to  our clients because it woul d lead to reduced access to 
"credit, increased borrowing costs, deter economic growth  and present budgetary c onstraints. For example, "
higher capital requirements may lead banks to reduce lend ing to local governments and public authorities. This 
"could result in reduced access to credit for vital infrastructure projec ts, school expansions, and other public "
investments necessary for community development. We must keep in mind that such ill-planned proposal s have serious consequences . I urge you to carefully 
consider the potential adverse effects of raising capita l requirements on banks. Striking a balance that ensures 
financial stability while also allowing  banks to support the financial needs of our public sector clients is crucial 
"for the well-being of all of our communities. Sincerely, "
Danny Nelson
