"Hello,"
"My name is Jamiel Robinson, and I am the Founder and CEO of Grand Rapids Area Black"
"Businesses(GRABB), an organization committed to fostering economic development withinthe Black community and expanding opportunities for Black entrepreneurs in the Metro GrandRapids area. I am writing to express my deep concerns regarding the potential consequencesof an increase in capital requirements for banks. I am worried about the impact this rule couldhave on small businesses, particularly those owned by Black entrepreneurs."
 
"I commend the Federal Reserve for its dedication to maintaining a robust and stable financialsystem,which is crucial for the well-being of our country. However, I believe it is essential toconsider the implications of any changes in capital requirements on the diverse landscape ofsmall businesses,especially those that have historically faced systemic barriers."
 
"Black-owned small businesses in Michigan, like many across the United States, have longgrappled with economic disparities and financial challenges. These enterprises play a vital rolein our communities, not only by creating jobs but also by fostering economic empowermentand equity. The Black community has faced disproportionate challenges when seeking accessto capital and resources, making it even more critical to take their unique circumstances intoaccount when making policy decisions that affect their operations. Leaders should be lookingto improve access to loans and credits and this proposal would only further restrict access tomuch-needed financing, hindering their growth and potential for job creation."
 
"When making a decision, you should also consider all that has been done to foster a strongfinancial system. After the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, our banks have continued to provetheir ability to keep our economy going even in the face of crisis. We all saw that firsthandduring the COVID-19 pandemic.All this to say that implementing this proposal is completelyunwarranted, particularly given the harm it would cause."
 
"Thatâ€™s why I urge the Federal Reserve to take a holistic approach when considering changes tocapital requirements, ensuring that they do not disproportionately burden small businessesowned by Blackentrepreneurs."
