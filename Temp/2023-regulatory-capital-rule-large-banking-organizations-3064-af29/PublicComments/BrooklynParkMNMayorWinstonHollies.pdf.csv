"As a mayor, we are dedicated to promoting eco nomic empowerment and opportunities for African-"
"American, immigrant and BIPOC entrepreneurs an d businesses. We have advocated for policies "
"that facilitate access to cap ital and foster economic  growth and spoken up against proposals, like "
"this one, that would be detrimental to the  economic stability of our community.  "
"I believe that raising capital requirements for banks, as included in the  recent proposal, could "
"potentially hinder the ability of Bl ack-owned businesses to secure the financing they need to start, "
"grow, and sustain their operations.  "
"We know that Black, immigrant and BIPOC owned bu sinesses have a long his tory of challenges in "
accessing affordable credit . Increasing capital requirements for banks will add more restrictions in 
"their ability to obtain loans an d lines of credit, which will limit their potential to grow.  "
Access to capital is a fundamental factor in entrepreneurship and w ealth building. By limiting 
"opportunities for Black, immigrant and BIPOC entrep reneurs, we risk impeding the ability of these "
Americans to accumulate wealth and invest in their communities. It is crucial that you consider the 
potential adverse consequences of raising ca pital requirements on these businesses and 
communities.  
"Thank you,  "
