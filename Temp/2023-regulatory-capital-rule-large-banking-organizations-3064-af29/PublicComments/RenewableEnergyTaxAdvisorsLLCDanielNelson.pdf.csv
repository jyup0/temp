"Ladies and Gentlemen,  "
 
"In connection with your Notice of Proposed Rulemaking  (“NOPR ”) on regulatory capital, we are ple ased "
to submit comments concerning the proper risk weighting of U.S. tax equity investment s in renewable 
"energy projects . As explained herein , we urge you to retain the 100% risk weighting for qualifying  "
"renewable energy  U.S. tax  credit financings , consist ent with the NOPR’s proposed treatment for U.S.  Low "
Income Housing Tax Credit  (“LIHTC ”) investments . 
 
Renewable Energy Tax Advisors LLC ( “RETA ”) is a boutique tax consulting firm serving the U.S. clean energy 
"industry.  RETA’s clients include U.S. tax equity investors, project developers and sponsors, manufacturers  "
"of renewable energy equipment, and contractors  who engineer and construct the projects . "
 
BACKGROUND:  
 
U.S. Banks provide over 80% -90% of the tax equity  financ ing for U.S. tax credit investment s in renewable 
energy project s. Most  returns on these  tax equity financing s are in the form of U.S. income tax credits and 
other U.S. tax benefits. Financing these U.S. tax credits is critical  in promoting important public welfare Renewable Energy Tax Advisors LLC

" goals of combating climate change , creating domestic job s, and expand ing domestic investment, as "
"reflected in the provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 , in which  the U.S. Government broadly "
expanded and increased renewable ene rgy U.S. tax incentives.  
 
"Under the current bank regulatory capital framework, these low-risk U.S. tax equity investment  financing s "
"carry a 100% risk weighting, provided a bank’s total equity investments are less than 10% of its capital. "
The current regulatory framework applies a 100% risk weighting to both LIHTC and renewable energy tax 
credit transactions.  
 
Renewable energy U.S. tax equity financings are materially different from speculative private equity 
"investments and, as discussed later, are similar in nature to other U.S. tax credit financings such as LIHTC  "
"transactions. From an underwriting standpoint, t hese transaction s are intentionally structured to be very "
"low risk and the yields are similar to debt, reflecting the low risk profile of the underlying investment s. "
"These U.S. tax credit financings are attractive to banks as they carry little, if any, entrepreneurial ris ks, and "
most  of the returns are based on U.S. government tax incentives . Project cash flows are typically  highly 
"contracted / bond -like with investment grade counterparties. Additionally, the U.S. tax equity investor "
typically has structural protections against project underperformance and legal mechanisms to protect 
"against issues such as tax credi t recapture risk.   Finally, the investor’s returns in these U.S. tax equity "
financings are never dependent on appreciation in the value of the underlying project company.  The 
typical tax equity transaction structures are well known and have been successf ully utilized to finance 
hundreds of projects over the past 15 years . 
 
"For these and other reasons, both the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board (“ FASB ”) as well as the "
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“ OCC ”) have concluded that many of the se U.S. tax equity 
"financings are very different from other private equity investments. Based on these conclusions, both the "
FASB and OCC provide for special treatment of most  U.S. tax equity financings.  
 
FASB Guidance . The F ASB recently expanded its spec ial non -equity /non -cash method accounting 
"treatment to renewable energy  U.S. tax credit equity financings, acknowledging the unique characteristics "
of these transactions  (the “FASB Guidance ”)1. Back in 2014 the FASB first added a special U .S. GAAP 
"accounting rule regarding LIHTC  projects. Under this special rule, qualified U.S. tax equity investments in "
LIHTC projects mad e primarily for the purpose of receiving U.S. income tax credits needn’t be accounted 
"for under the normal equity method or cost method of accounting. Instead, they could be accounted for "
"under a proportionate amortization method (“ PAM ”) of accounting. In allowing the PAM method, the FASB "
explained  these type s of U.S. tax equity financing investments receive substantially all their return through 
"the receipt of U.S. tax credits and other tax benefits , and thus  have  substantially  “different risks and "
rewards  than do traditional equity investments.”  
 
"While the 2014 rule focused on  LIHTC investments, the FASB recommended  considering expanding the "
"PAM to other U.S. tax credit financings, including those in renewable energy projects. Accordingly, the "
FASB then launched a study to formally consider expanding the PAM to other U.S. tax credit financings 
including renewable energy U.S. tax credit investments.

Ventures ” addressing the “Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional A mortization 
Method ”. Renewable Energy Tax Advisors LLC

" In March of this year, the FASB formally  expand ed the ability to use the PAM to renewable energy U.S. tax "
"equity investments, provided  the profile of th e investment satisfie s certain requirements.  "
 
"Among the requirements  to qualify for PAM  accounting  under the FASB Guidance , a tax equity investment "
financing (i) must expect that “substantially all the projected benefits are from income tax credits and 
other tax benefits ” (ii) must have a  projec ted yield that  is positive based sol ely on income tax cred its and 
"other tax benefits, and (ii) be a limit ed liability investment .  "
 
"OCC Guidance . In recognition of these and other reasons, OCC issued guidance in 2021 confirming  banks ’ "
ability  to participate in U.S. tax equity financing s under its general lending authority  (the “OCC 
"Guidance ”)2. Specifically, a national bank  may invest in a “tax equity financing ” provided that such "
transaction  is the “functional equivalent  of a loan ”. Such a determination is  based on a strict seven -part 
test and the satisfaction of five additional requirements . It’s worth noting that the 2021 OCC guidance was 
"issued in appreciation of, years after the  release of, the  Basel III accord.  "
 
"Among the lo w-risk and debt -like indicators need ed to qualify under the OOC Guidance, the tax equity "
investment must (i) be structured so the tax benefits and other payments fully  repay the investment and 
"provide the expected rate of return, (ii) be of limited tenure tied to the tax credit timeframe and exp ected "
"rate of return period, (ii) not rely on any appreci ation in th e overall project, (iii) follow a structure  necessary "
"for m onetizing the tax ben efits, and (iv) follow underwriting and credit approval criteria similar to "
commercial loans . 
 
NOPR TREATMENT OF TAX EQUITY INVE STMENT  FINANCING S 
 
"On July 28, 2023 , the OCC, the FDIC, and the Federal Reserve issued the  NOPR regarding regulatory capital.  "
 
The NOPR would retain the 100% risk weight for  a narrow set of  equity investments in certain public 
"welfare investments  such as the LIHTC investments , where substantially all the investment returns are in "
the form of U.S. income tax credits  and other tax benefits . The NOPR explain ed the rationale for retaining 
"the 100%  risk weight on these  LIHTC equity exposures, by statin g they  “generally receive favorable tax "
treatment and/or investment subsidies that make their risk and return characteristics different than equity 
investments in general. Recognizing this more favorable risk -return structure and the importance of these 
"investments to promoting important public welfare goals, the proposal would effectively retain the "
treatment of equity exposures that qualify as community development investments and equity exposures 
to small business investment companies under the current c apital rule and assign such exposures a 100 
percent risk weight. ” 
 
"However, the NOPR would increase the capital risk weight for all other non -public investments to 400%, a "
"four-fold increase. While t his 400% risk weight would apply to speculative private e quity investment s, it "
"would also apply  to low-risk renewable energy U.S. tax credit equity financing s, even though  LIHTC tax "
equity investments and renewable energy tax equity investments share the same relevant characteristics .  
 
COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION S

 It is surprising the NOPR allows for a 100% risk weighting for LIHTC tax credit financings  but requires a 
"400% risk weighting for renewable  energy tax credit financings. If anything , renewable energy U.S. income "
"tax credits arguably  have a  lower risk profile than  LIHTC ’s, since the LIHTC recapture period can be as long "
"as 15 years while clean energy tax credit recapture periods, if any, are generally only  5 years.  Additionally , "
requiring a 400% capital risk weight for low-risk U.S. tax cred it financings is inconsistent with the actual 
"risk profile of these arrangements, particularly for those investments that qualify under  the OCC’s 2021 "
guidance or the FABS’s 2023 guidance.   
 
It seems that the decision to apply a 100% risk weighting to LIHTC U.S. tax equity financings but a 400% 
risk weighting to similar renewable energy U.S. tax equity financings was unintended and was an 
inadvertent oversight.  
 
"Further, l umping these low -risk U.S. government tax credit financings in with s peculative private equity "
investments would be misguided. Such a “one size fits all” risk weighting requirement would devastate the 
"U.S. Tax Equity financing market s. Quite simply, regarding U.S. tax equity financing investments  in "
"renewable energy project s, requiring  a 400% risk weight  is a solution in search of a problem.  "
 
"Accordingly, we  recommend the risk weight for “qualif ying ” U.S. income tax credit financing  investments  "
in renewable energy projects  be consistent with the risk weight afforded LIHTC investments . Both should 
be subject to a 100% risk weighting. For these purposes we recommend a “ qualifying ” U.S. income tax 
credit financing be any  U.S. tax equity investment that qualifies for special tr eatment under e ither the  
above -noted  OCC Guidance or FASB Guidance .  
 
"Based on this approach, we recommend the 100% risk weighting categories in the NOPR’s table for “ Risk "
Weights Applicable to Equity Exposures under the Expanded Simple Risk -Weight Approac h (ESRWA) ” be 
expanded to as follows:  
 
 
RISK WEIGHTING  EQUITY EXPOSURE  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
100%  An equity exposure that qualifies as a community 
development investment under section 24 (Eleventh) 
of the National Bank Act  
An equity exposure to an unconsolidated small 
business investment company or held through a 
"consolidated small business investment company, as "
described in section 302 of the Small Business 
Investment Act.  
An equity exposure to a U.S. tax credit investment 
eligible for the propo rtional amortization method 
pursuant to the FASB’s Accounting Standards Update 
2023 -02. 
An equity exposure that qualifies as a tax equity 
finance investment under 12 CFR 7.1024 . 
400%  An equity exposure that is not publicly traded.

"Lastly, we also recommend you consider applying these two additional 100% risk weighting classifications "
"on a “to the extent” basis . For example, assume a bank invests $80 X into a renewable energy U.S. tax "
"equity financing  but, based on the project’s  U.S.  tax benefits , only a $75X investment would have qualified "
"for the 100% risk weighting . Under a “to the extent” rule , the risk weighting for the first $75X of investment "
"would be 100%, while only the excess $ 5X investment would be subject to the 400% risk weighting.  "
 
SUMMARY  
 
One of t he stated goal s of the NOPR is to update capital requirements to “better reflect the risks of these 
"banking organizations’ exposures.” In the case of most U.S. income tax equity investment financings, a "
four-fold increase in the required capital requirement does not “better reflect the risk s” of such low-risk 
investments. Both the FASB and the OCC have identified the unique low-risk characteristics of m ost U.S. 
"tax equity financings and  have accordingly afforded special treatment to these financings. Indeed, the "
NOPR  acknowledges the  uniquene ss of these types  of financings in allowing a 100% risk weight for 
"similar ly structured  LIHTC investments . Lastly, t he NOPR’s proposed 4 -fold increase in risk weight would "
have the unintended consequence of wreaking havoc on the stable and efficient U.S. t ax equity 
"marketplace. Instead, we encourage you to allow equity exposures in “qualified”  U.S. tax credit "
investments in renewable energy projects to maintain their current 100% risk weighting .
